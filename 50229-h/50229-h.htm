<h2><em>A Journal of a Voyage from <strong>England</strong>
to <strong>Constantinople</strong>, made in
the Year, 1668. by <strong>T. Smith</strong>,
D. D. and F. R. S.</em></h2>


<p>On <em>Monday</em> Evening <em>August 3, 1668.</em>
we took Barge at <em>Tower-Wharf</em>, and
at <em>Greenwich</em> went on Board the
<em>Bezant</em> Yacht for the <em>Downs</em>, where we arrived
the next day in the Afternoon, and
went on Board the <em>Leopard</em> Frigat, a Ship of
56 Guns mounted, Captain <em>O Bryen</em> Commander,
appointed to carry Sir <em>Daniel Harvey</em>,
his Majesty's Ambassador to the Port of
the <em>Ottoman</em> Emperor at <em>Constantinople</em>. Here,
upon his first Arrival, the Ambassador was
Complemented by Sir <em>Jeremy Smith</em>, then riding
Admiral, Sir <em>Edward Spragg</em>, and several
other Commanders of the Men of War,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
and afterwards Saluted with Fifteen Pieces
of Ordinance by the Admiral, to whom we
returned as many; then by the Vice-Admiral,
and several other Ships. All which were
answered together at the same time with 21
in the whole.</p>

<p>Here we were forced to Ride for several
days, the Winds being contrary.</p>

<p>In the <em>Offing</em> between the <em>North Foreland</em>
and <em>South Foreland</em> it runs Tide and half Tide,
that is, it is either ebbing Water or Flood
upon the Shore, in that part of the <em>Downs</em>,
three hours, which is grossly speaking the
time of half a Tide, before it is so, off at Sea.
(For the flux and reflux of the Sea is not
made exactly twice in 24 hours, but, as it
appears by accurate observation, it requires
an overplus of almost 50 minutes.) The
reason of this diversity of Tides, I take to be
from the meeting of the two Seas in that
narrow Streight.</p>

<p>Oftentimes when the Wind has blown hard
at N. E. or at W. or W. and by S. there has
hapn'd an alteration of the Tides in the
River of <em>Thames</em>, which ignorant People have
mistakenly lookt upon as a Prodigy.</p>

<p>It is a most certain Observation, that
where it flows Tide and half Tide, tho' the
Tide of Flood runs aloft, yet the Tide of Ebb
runs under foot, that is, close by the <em>ground</em>;
and so at the Tide of Ebb, it will flow under
foot, as that great and experienc'd Sea-Commander,
Sir <em>H. Manwaring</em>, words it.</p>

<p><em>August 9.</em> We sailed from the <em>Downs</em>, but
were soon forced back by distress of Weather,
and came to an Anchor S. W. of the <em>South
Foreland</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>10. The Wind blew at S. S. W. and the
Sea run very high, so that we were in danger
of losing our Cable and Anchor; the Ground,
where we rode, at 16 Fathom ½ water, being
somewhat gruff.</p>

<p>15. The Wind coming about at W. N. W.
we sailed, and were Saluted with nine Guns
from <em>Dover</em> Castle, and seven from one Fort,
and five from another. We carried a Flag
upon our Maintop, after we came out of the
<em>Downs</em>. The Wind in the Afternoon at N. E.
brought us by seven of the Clock to the <em>Ness</em>,
where we lay at Anchor during the Tide
of Flood; during which time the Mariners
caught good store of <em>Whitings</em>, baiting their
Hooks with raw Mutton.</p>

<p>16. We were in the morning athwart St.
<em>Helen</em>'s Point in the <em>Isle of Wight</em>; where we
discovered Sir <em>Thomas Allen</em> with his Squadron
under Sail, bound for the <em>Straits</em>.</p>

<p>17. In the morning we got to the West of
<em>Portland</em>, the Wind at N. by E. our Course
lying thereupon S. S. W. but about noon,
sailing over part of the Race of <em>Portland</em>,
where we met with a tumbling Sea, we Anchored
at the N. W. part in the Bay, over
against the Point that looks towards <em>Weymouth</em>.
We were ashore in the Island, which
seems to be but one continued Rock; the
Soil in several places not being above five or
six Inches deep, as I found by digging a hole
with my Knife; yet the Corn flourishing
enough. The Castle consists of a double Fortification;
we could not observe above five
Guns mounted. They told us, that in the
Island there was but 1 Church, and 4 Villages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>We weighed at twelve of the Clock at
night: But</p>

<p>18. The Wind blowing fiercely at W. directly
in our teeth, we made but little way,
and could not weather the <em>Start</em> Point that
night. The Moon upon its first emerging
above the Horizon, seemed to have a colour
like burnt Brick, the Sky very cloudy: but
some Rain falling, as she advanced higher
and higher, she appeared more and more
fiery.</p>

<p>19. We weathered the <em>Start</em> Point by
noon, but could not make much way beyond
it.</p>

<p>20. We got into <em>Plymouth</em> Sound. The
Cittadel, built upon a Rock, with large
Counterscarps and Bastions, returned our Salute
with nine Guns. Sir <em>Thomas Allen</em> with
his Fleet stood to the Lizard, and came not
to an Anchor.</p>

<p>21. Misty Weather. About eleven Clock
Forenoon, and about six in the Evening, we
observed the Vapours in great quantity
ascend out of the Sea, soon covering the tops
of the Mountains. Here we staid three days,
taking in some Provisions, ready prepared
for us.</p>

<p>On <em>Sunday</em> the 23<em>d</em> of <em>August</em> we weighed
out of <em>Plymouth</em> Sound, and made the <em>Lizard</em>,
a Promontory in <em>Cornwall</em>, before night:
The <em>Manacles</em>, several Rocks so called, we
discerned very distinctly, it being then low
Ebb; as also the Lands end. The Wind
blew fresh; and we observed the Waves in
the Night-time, as if they had been liquid
Fire, but palish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>Lizard</em> bearing N. of us, we changed
our Course, and taking leave of <em>England</em>, we
sailed into the Ocean. God of his Mercy
send us a happy Voyage.</p>

<p>24. We run this day thirty nine Leagues
by a Compute from our Log-line.</p>

<p>25. We were full open with the <em>Bay of
Biscay</em>. Several <em>Gulls</em> were hovering over the
Surface of the Water to catch Fish, which
swam by in vast sholes, at about 50 Leagues
distance from any Land.</p>

<p>At other times I have seen several Birds
floating upon the Water, which being driven
by some Tempest from the Coasts of <em>Spain</em>
and <em>Portugal</em>, have been tired in their flight,
and so drowned. This happens frequently
in the great Ocean, where they meet with
no Land to fly to in several hundreds of
Leagues; and sometimes even in the <em>Mediterranean</em>,
in the Mid-Seas between the <em>Christian</em>
and <em>Barbary</em> Shores. In blowing Weather,
among other Birds flying cross, we
saw a Hawk making to our Ship, then under
good and swift Sail, which perched upon the
round-top of the Main-mast; which one of
the Seamen espying, he presently run up the
Shrouds, and brought down the Hawk, which
made no attempt to fly away, being quite
spent. But not long after, the Hawk recovering
his Spirits by rest and meat which was
given him, took wing and got away from the
Fellow, notwithstanding all the care he took
to secure his new Adventure, which he hoped
to have made Mony of at the next Port that
we should come to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>26. A strong Levant still blowing, and the
Sea very rough and boisterous, the Gale continuing
almost right a stern, we run these
24 hours above 70 Leagues.</p>

<p>27. We found our selves by our observations,
that we were in the Latitude of 42
degrees 17 minutes, and began to be very
sensible of our nearer approach to the South,
the Weather being excessive hot. In the
Afternoon we heard the report of several
Guns fired at about seven or eight Leagues
distance, as we guessed. At eight of the
Clock at night another Gun was fired somewhat
near us, which we thought might be
from an <em>Algerine</em> Man of War, who gave a
signal to his Consorts, and who answered by
several flashes of Powder. Whereupon our
Trumpeters sounded a Point of War, but no
return was made. However, the Captain
quartered his Men, and the Decks were
cleared, and all things made ready in order
to a Fight the next Morning; as soon as day
appeared, we saw the Sea clear, no Ships
being in view any way: so that we concluded
that they were Merchant-Ships, with their
Convoy, standing to the Northward.</p>

<p>28. Dreadful Lightnings in the Clouds towards
the Evening; after which great Dews
fell: the Weather extream hot.</p>

<p>29. We saw a Pilot-fish swim by the sides
of the Ship, and several Bonito's and Albicores
playing, as it were with their Heads
above Water. The Wind took us short in
the night, and soon after there was a stark
Calm; and we had great reason to bless God
for it: For had we continued our Course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
that night, we had either run a-ground, or
had been cast upon the Rocks near to <em>Peniche</em>
in <em>Portugal</em>. The fault was mis-reckoning,
and haling in too soon to make the <em>Southern
Cape</em>: though the Seamen, to salve their Credit,
and to excuse their Error, which had
like to have proved so fatal to us, pretended
that we were set in by a strong Current.
God make us thankful for this great Deliverance.</p>

<p>30. This Morning we were surprized to
see our selves within four or five Leagues of
the Shore, when we had thought that we had
been above twenty. In the Afternoon, the
Wind coming on fresh, we weathered the
westermost Isle of the <em>Barlings</em>. On the
greatest of which, being as we guessed, above
half a Mile in length, the <em>Portuguese</em> have
built a Fort to hinder the <em>Barbary</em> Pirates
from careening their Ships there, or taking
in fresh Water. The Land of it very high,
and bore off us S. E. by E. By it lie several
Rocks. The other Islands are distant
about a League. I told five of them: the
greatest of which last lie somewhere inward
to the Shore.</p>

<p>For two Nights together about this time
(28 and 29) the Sky being very hazy, the
Sun set in a colour as deep as Blood, which
was very astonishing. We were then in the
Latitude of 40.</p>

<p>31. Betimes in the Morning we sailed by
the Rock of <em>Lisbon</em>, at some distance, which
was scarce discernible by reason of the cloudiness
of the Weather. Two <em>Turks</em> Men of
War are now plying to the Windward of us;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
but dare not come up to speak with us, perceiving
that we are only laden with Powder
and Bullet.</p>

<p><em>September 1.</em> In the Morning we made Cape
<em>St. Vincent</em>. I went on Shore with the Lieutenant
and several others in our Pinnace,
which we drove into one of the Coves; and
were forced to climb up a Rock, the ascent of
which was very dangerous and troublesome;
and made more so by the Rays of the Sun,
which were reflected with that vehemence,
that the Heat was almost intolerable. Having
gained the top, we were met by an Officer
and some Soldiers, who had us into the
Castle, the middlemost of the three, which
are built along that Promontory for the Security
of the Coasts, and entertained us with
Wine, Grapes, and Marmalade. They told
us, that a Squadron of English Men of War
sailed by the day before. We here met with
two Vessels belonging to <em>Dartmouth</em>, laden
with Fish from <em>Newfoundland</em>, bound for <em>Alicant</em>.
All along the Coasts, at the distance
of about two or three Leagues, are several
Watch-towers built to give notice of Pirates.</p>

<p>Becalmed for the most part these two or
three days.</p>

<p>5. In the Morning we weathered the Point
of <em>Cadiz</em>, and came to an Anchor in the <em>Bay
of Bulls</em>, about half a League from the great
<em>Porgoe</em>; and in the Afternoon went on shore.
We were entertained by the <em>English</em> Consul,
and carried by him to view the Fortifications,
which are esteemed to be as regular as
any in <em>Christendom</em>; built in the same place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
where the Town had been attacked formerly
by the <em>English</em>, under the Conduct of the
Earl of <em>Essex</em> in the Reign of Q. <em>Elizabeth</em>.
Plays are usually here, as in other parts of
<em>Spain</em>, acted on a <em>Sunday</em>. During the time
of our stay, was represented the History of
the Patience of <em>Job</em>, the Devil brought upon
the Stage, tempting <em>Job</em>'s Wife in a drolling
way, which caused great Laughter and Merriment
among the Spectators. At <em>Malaga</em>,
as the Merchants told us, the <em>Sunday</em> before
we arrived there, was acted the <em>Schism of
England</em> in the time of King <em>Henry</em> the Eighth,
whom the <em>Spaniards</em> will not yet forgive, for
Divorcing himself from Q. <em>Catherine</em>, their
Country-Woman.</p>

<p>9. We sailed from <em>Cadiz</em>.</p>

<p>10. This Afternoon we were forced to Anchor,
not far from <em>Cape Spartel</em> or <em>Sprat</em>, as
the Seamen call it, not being able to weather
the Point.</p>

<p>11. This day we came to an Anchor in
<em>Tangier-Bay</em>, with Sir <em>Thomas Allen</em>'s Squadron.</p>

<p><em>Tangier</em> lies within the Entrance into the
<em>Strait</em> of the <em>Mediterranean</em>, in the Latitude
of about 35°, 36´. It is situated in the bottom
of a Bay, and is built on the side of the Hill,
overlooking the Sea, encompassed with high
Walls to the Land-ward, and commanded by
a strong Castle. The Heats would be very
troublesome but for the Sea-breezes which
cool and fan the Air. In the Castle I met
with a <em>Roman</em> Monument, erected to the
Honour of <em>P. Belius</em>, a great Officer and
Souldier in <em>Trajan</em>'s time; who, among his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
other Titles, is there stiled, PPO. FIG.
MAURITANIAE. TINGITANAE:
which since has been taken away, and presented
to the University of <em>Oxon</em> by Sir <em>Hugh
Cholmondley</em>, and now serves to adorn the
<em>Area</em> about the <em>Theatre</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>English</em> have two Churches here,
(though they only make use of one, the other
being reserved against all Accidents) both of
them very neat and convenient; though not
to be compared with the Church of the <em>Portuguese</em>,
retained still, according to the Articles
of Agreement, when the King of <em>Portugal</em>
made over the Right and Title, and
gave the Possession of <em>Tangier</em> to the Crown
of <em>England</em>, by the Canons Regulars, belonging
to it, which is very stately, and adorn'd
with rich Images, and supported by Marble
Pillars. Toward one end of the <em>English</em>
Church, just by the Vestiary, which had been
formerly a <em>Turkish</em> Mosch, and afterward
the Chappel of a Convent of <em>Dominicans</em>,
is a Monumental Stone-Table in <em>Arabick</em>
Characters, containing an account of the
Houses, Lands, and other Revenues belonging
to it, set up in the 743 year of the <em>Hegira</em>,
that is, of Christ 1341. The Mole is in
good forwardness, they having gained above
200 yards in the Sea, in order to the making
of a good and safe Harbour for Ships
to ride in, which lye open to Wind and
Waves; the outward side to the Seaward
somewhat sloping. The Garrison is in so
good a posture of Defence, that they defy
<em>Taffiletta</em> and all his Forces. Here we met
with great Civilities from Colonel <em>Norwood</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Deputy-Governour, and the Gentlemen belonging
to the Garrison. Sir <em>Harry Mildmay</em>
and Mr. <em>Goodland</em>, two of King <em>Charles</em>
the First his Judges, are here; but who have
the Liberty of the Town. Now, at our being
here, come in several <em>Moors</em> from <em>Arzilla</em>,
and among the rest, the Father of one of
<em>Gayland</em>'s Wives, to get a Passage for <em>Algiers</em>.</p>

<p>Old <em>Tangier</em> lyes at some little distance,
where they find very frequently in digging
several pieces of <em>Roman</em> Coin. But for the above-mentioned,
and the other Curiosities
and Antiquities of <em>Tangier</em>, of which I forbear
to make mention, from the imperfect and hasty
Observations of two days, the greatest
part of which being taken up by the Entertainment
of our obliging Country-men, you
may consult with great pleasure and satisfaction,
a little Book called <em>The present State
of Tangier</em>, written by a very ingenious Gentleman,
and printed in the Year 1676.</p>

<p>There is a vast <em>draught</em> of <em>water</em> poured continually
out of the <em>Atlantick</em> into the <em>Mediterranean</em>,
the mouth or entrance of which between
<em>Cape Spartel</em> or <em>Sprat</em>, as the <em>sea-men</em>
call it, and <em>Cape Trafalgar</em>, may be near 7
leagues wide, the <em>current</em> setting strong into
it, and not losing its force till it runs as
far as <em>Malaga</em>, which is about 20 leagues within
the <em>Streights</em>. By the benefit of this <em>Current</em>,
tho' the wind be contrary, if it does
not over-blow, <em>Ships</em> easily turn into the <em>gut</em>,
as they term the <em>narrow passage</em>, which is about
20 miles in length. At the end of
which are two Towns, <em>Gibraltar</em> on the coast
of <em>Spain</em>, which gives denomination to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
<em>Streight</em>, and <em>Ceuta</em> on the <em>Barbary</em> coast: at
which places <em>Hercules</em> is supposed to have set
up his <em>Pillars</em>. What becomes of this great
quantity of water poured in this way, and of
that, which runs from the <em>Euxine</em> into the
<em>Bosporous</em> and <em>Propontis</em>, and is carried at last
through the <em>Hellespont</em> into the <em>Ægæan</em> or
<em>Archipelago</em>, is a curious <em>speculation</em>, and has
exercised the wit and understanding of <em>Philosophers</em>
and <em>Navigators</em>. For there is no sensible
rising of the <em>water</em> all along the <em>Barbary
Coast</em>, even down to <em>Alexandria</em>, the land beyond
<em>Tripoli</em>, and that of <em>Ægypt</em>, lying very
low, and easily overflowable. They observe
indeed, that the water rises 3 feet, or
3 feet and an half, in the <em>gulph</em> of <em>Venice</em>,
and as much, or very near as much, all along
the <em>Riviera</em> of <em>Genoa</em>, as far as the river
<em>Arno</em>: but this rather adds to the wonder.</p>

<p>I here omit to speak at large of the several
<em>Hypotheses</em> which have been invented to solve
this difficulty: such as <em>subterraneous vents</em>,
cavities and indraughts, <em>exhalations</em> by the
<em>Sun-beams</em>, the running out of the water on
the <em>African side</em>, as if there were a kind of
circular motion of the water, and that it only
flowed in upon the <em>Christian</em> shore: which
latter I look upon as a meer fancy, and contrary
to all observation.</p>

<p>My conjecture is, that there is an <em>under-Current</em>,
whereby as great a quantity of water
is carried out, as comes flowing in. To confirm
which, besides what I have said above about
the difference of tides in the <em>offing</em>, and
at the <em>Shore</em> in the <em>Downs</em>, which necessarily
supposes an <em>under-Current</em>, I shall present you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
with an instance of the like nature in the <em>Baltick
Sound</em>, as I received it from an able Seaman,
who was at the making of the tryal.</p>

<p>He told me, that being there in one of the
<em>King's</em> Frigats, they went with their <em>Pinnace</em>
into the <em>middle stream</em>, and were carried violently
by the <em>Current</em>: that soon after they
sank a <em>bucket</em> with a large <em>Cannon</em> bullet to a
certain <em>depth</em> of water, which gave check to
the boats motion, and sinking it still lower
and lower, the <em>boat</em> was driven a-head to
wind-ward against the upper <em>Current</em>: the
<em>current</em> aloft, as he added, not being above
4 or 5 <em>fathom</em> deep, and that the lower the
bucket was let fall, they found the <em>under-Current</em>
the stronger. I designed to have
made the <em>Experiment</em> in the <em>Streights-Channel</em>;
but both times I past, the Easterly wind blew
so hard, that there was no putting out the
boat with any safety; nor indeed at those
times had we any leisure for such a <em>Curiosity</em>;
which those, who liv'd at <em>Tangier</em>, might
have tryed without any difficulty or danger.</p>

<p>This conjecture, how likely or unlikely soever,
will stand or fall according to the certainty
of the <em>Observations</em>, which shall be made
there, which I will endeavour to procure in
order to the further establishment, or utter
overthrow of it.</p>

<p>13. We weighed out of <em>Tangier</em> and turned
into the <em>Strait</em>, though against the Wind.
The distance between <em>Gibraltar</em> Cape, which
gives name to the <em>Straits</em>, and is joyned to
the Continent of <em>Spain</em> and <em>Ceuta</em> a well-built
and strongly fortified Town, lying under the
Hill <em>Alybe</em>, called so by the <em>Greeks</em>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the Seamen commonly call, as do some <em>Spanish</em>
Writers, <em>Apes-hill</em>, from the great number
of Apes which used formerly to haunt there,
(at which places <em>Hercules</em> is feigned to have
set up his Pillars) may be about six Leagues;
tho' both Lands lying very high (for we saw the
Clouds much below them) it does not appear
in the middle of the Current, out of a tall
Ship, scarce half so broad.</p>

<p>14. Little Wind stirring.</p>

<p>15. A great Mist all the Sea over, so that
we could scarce see three lengths of the Ship,
which began to vanish in the Afternoon; and
than we descryed the <em>Cape of Malaga</em> at about
four Leagues distance; and came to an Anchor
that Night. The City lies under a high
Hill, and is the Seat of a Bishop, who is at
this time a Natural Son of King <em>Philip</em> the
Fourth, of the Order of St. <em>Dominic</em>. Here
the Merchants told us, that it had not rained
for seven Months together, except a day or
two for an Hour: and that the <em>Algerines</em>,
who were then breaking with us, had not
been able to have set a Fleet to Sea about
two years before, if they had not been furnished
with Masts from <em>England</em>; and that
they were now in Expectation of another
Ship laden with the same, notwithstanding
the Rupture, which was as good as began.
I only make a Query, Whether <em>Jews</em> or <em>English</em>
Men were the Freighters?</p>

<p>16. The next Morning the Governour immediately
returned our Salute Gun for Gun:
soon after we weighed from <em>Malaga</em> Road,
the Weather very hot. Some Rain fell at
Night, though very moderately. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Evening, after we had sailed about eighteen
Leagues, we were becalm'd. The Sea being
quiet, we saw a great number of <em>Tortoises</em>
swimming above Water, several <em>Bottle-noses</em>,
fish of about three yards long, and very
thick, and Hawks flying over to the <em>Barbary</em>
Coast. The Hills of <em>Granada</em> were seen
plainly by us, though at a great distance.</p>

<p>The Wind coming Easterly, we kept at
Sea, beating and plying to and again for
these four days, scarce gaining sixteen Leagues
of our way, and were forc'd to come to an
Anchor in the <em>Bay of Adera</em>, where there is
a strong Cittadel, about thirty four or thirty
five Leagues from <em>Malaga</em>.</p>

<p>21. We passed by <em>Cape de Gata</em>: but the
Levant wind still blowing, having continued
almost in that Point for above two Months,
as we computed from what they had told
us at <em>Tangier</em>, we could make but little progress
in our Voyage.</p>

<p>25. Between three and four of the Clock
in the Morning the Tornado's began to blow,
and the Wind violent for the time, with such
continued Flashes of Lightning for several
hours, as that the whole Sky seemed to be
on fire, intermixed with terrible Claps of
Thunder, after which followed great showers
of Rain.</p>

<p>25. The Wind still contrary, we descryed
<em>Cape St. Martin</em> at about fifteen Leagues distance.
Tacking about and standing off to
Seaward, next Morning 27. we found that
we had lost about three Leagues of our way.</p>

<p>28. We were athwart <em>Orlando's Gap</em> within
two Leagues of the Shore, <em>Cape St. Martin</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
bearing off us <em>N.</em> by <em>W.</em> The Wind now still;
but a swelling Sea coming from the Westward,
which is usual before a Wind, which
drives the Water before it.</p>

<p>On <em>Michaelmas-day</em> we were up with the
Island <em>Ivica</em>, or <em>Ivise</em>, as the Mariners call it,
and the Wind blowing fair, we stood our
Course; and the next day at Noon we made
the <em>Island Majorca</em>, situate over against the
Kingdom of <em>Valentia</em>, and came to an Anchor
in the <em>Bay</em> of the City, being forced in
hither for want of fresh Water. In the Afternoon
the Boat was sent on shore; but the
Vice-Roy would not give us Prattick, not
bringing a Patent from <em>Malaga</em>.</p>

<p><em>Octob. 1.</em> The Secretary was sent with the
King's Pass to the Vice-Roy to demand Prattick,
who presently summoned the Officers
of the <em>Sanita</em>. After long Debates and Delays
they consented, and came to the <em>Mole</em>
to receive him. He went directly to the
Governour to acquaint him, that we were
ready to Salute the City with what number
of Guns he pleased, if he would engage upon
his Honour to give us as many. He replied,
that he would give us three for five;
and wondered, that we being but a single
Ship, should make such a Demand. The Secretary
told him, That we were to be treated
as an Admiral, having a Flag on our Maintop;
and that the Governour of <em>Malaga</em>
had done it. To this he said, That <em>Majorca</em>
was a Kingdom, that he was the King's
Representative, and that by Reason of the
Miscarriage of his Predecessor, when Monsieur
<em>de Beaufort</em>, the <em>French</em> Admiral was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
there, he had received strict Orders from
<em>Madrid</em> not to do the like. The Secretary
replied, That we had an Ambassador on
board, and had as strict Orders, and should
answer as severely for the Breach of them.
His last Answer was, That we might, with
our Sails loose, keep before the Town, till
we had furnished our selves with what we
wanted. Upon receiving this Message, the
Ambassador dispatched away one <em>Joseph Gabriel
Cortez</em>, a <em>Spaniard</em>, but employed by the
<em>English</em> Merchants trading to that Island, then
on board our Ship, to acquaint him, That
when we were ready to go away, we would
loose our Sails, and not before. We landed
within the <em>Mole</em>; the Walk upon it about
four or five Yards broad; at the Extremity
of which is a very large and stately Gate,
which leads into the City. We went into
the great Church, somewhat wider than <em>Westminster-Abbey</em>,
but darkish within: the Portal
very magnificent, adorned with several Marble
Statues in Niches one over another. The
High Altar very plain and unadorned: but
others extraordinary rich and glorious. Not
far from the City are several Mills to grind
their Olives, Oyl being the great Commodity
of the Island.</p>

<p>2. The next Morning we weighed, without
taking any kind of notice of the Town,
sailing all along in sight of the Island, which
presented us with a pleasing and delightful
Prospect; the Valleys, lying under the Hills,
fruitful of Wine and Corn. The whole Island
is judged to be about sixty Leagues in Compass,
and in length about fifteen: which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
sailed from the Westermost Point, where lies
the Isle <em>Dragovera</em>, at a very little distance
to the Eastermost, where there is built a
small Fort. To the S. S. E. lie several little
Islands, called the <em>Cabreas</em>; between which
and <em>Majorca</em> we steered.</p>

<p>3. We were athwart <em>Port Maon</em> in <em>Minorca</em>;
a fine level Country, having but one Hill in
it N. W. by W. as it bore off us. In the Evening
the Wind very scant.</p>

<p>4. This day, as yesterday, excessive hot.</p>

<p>5. In the Afternoon we descryed the Main
Land of <em>Provence</em>.</p>

<p>6. We were over against the Islands <em>Hieres</em>
and the Highland of <em>Thoulon</em>.</p>

<p>7, 8. These two Days becalmed; and the
Sea extraordinary smooth.</p>

<p>9. We were over against the Westermost
part of the <em>Alpes</em>, which we distinctly saw at
about twenty Leagues distance, and appeared
far higher than the Hills of <em>Granada</em>.</p>

<p>10. We sailed by <em>Final</em> and <em>Ventimiglia</em>.</p>

<p>12. We came in the Morning to an Anchor
over against the <em>Mole</em>, and not far from
the Lantern in <em>Genoa</em>. Having obtained Prattick
of the <em>Maestri della Sanita</em>, after a little
demur about the Salute, the Senate being assembled,
and some of them protesting upon
their Honours, and ready to produce their
Registers, that they never saluted the Ship
wherein was an Ambassador of <em>France</em> or
<em>Spain</em>, as not taking any notice of the Person
who did bear that Character, 'till they
had first intimation, that the Ship was arrived
in their Port by its saluting the Town.
It was agreed that the Ship should Salute the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Town with eleven Guns, which they were to
answer, as they did, with an equal number:
and after a little pause, they saluted the Ambassador
with nineteen more, which was answered
with as many. After this, the Duke
and Senate sent the Master of the Ceremonies
to wait upon the Ambassador: who going
away, returned soon after with a Present
of Calves, Fowl, Wine, Sweetmeats, <em>&amp;c.</em>
and acquainted his Lordship, that they had
deputed six of their Gentlemen to Complement
him, and wait upon him; which Civility
he thought fit to refuse, desiring to be
<em>Incognito</em>. But however, going ashore, he was
welcomed by the <em>Illustrissimi Signiori</em>, the
<em>Durazzo's</em>, two Brothers, the elder of which
had been Ambassador for the Republick, in
the Court of <em>England</em>, and the other at <em>Constantinople</em>,
and by them carried to see the
<em>Villas</em> out of Town. The figure of <em>Genoa</em> is
Semicircular, beginning from the Lantern
Westward, lying under an high Hill, upon
the rising of which the several Houses, built
of Marble, afford a very fine Prospect, and
add much to the Beauty and Glory of the
place. <em>Strada nuova</em> perchance is the most
stately Street in the whole World. The new
Church of the <em>Annunciata</em>, built by the <em>Lomellini</em>,
where a thousand may go up the stairs
abreast at the same time, for curious Painting,
rich Altars, and exactness of Architecture,
incomparable. The <em>Duome</em> also and
the Church of the <em>Theatins</em> very stately and
curious. Other matters I purposely omit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>14. In the Evening we set Sail from <em>Genoa</em>.</p>

<p>Becalmed for the most part these three
Days, though helped somewhat forward by
the Breezes that blew off the shore after Sun
set.</p>

<p>18. In the Afternoon we made the Island
<em>Gorgonia</em>, about nine Leagues from <em>Livorne</em>;
a little round Island, with a Castle on the
top.</p>

<p>19. In the Morning we came to an Anchor
in <em>Livorne</em> Road, about a Mile from the
Town: the Road large and secure, especially
to the Northward. The Ambassador keeps
on Board, the Governour refusing to Salute
the Ship first, though he had formerly saluted
the <em>French</em>; pretending that every Convoy
might carry a Flag; and alledging that his
Master, the Grand Duke, was as great and
absolute, as the Republick of <em>Genoa</em>: and
that they had rather throw themselves upon
the King of <em>England</em>, than do a thing which
might prove of such an ill Consequence.
Sir <em>John Finch</em>, his Majesty's Resident, together
with Sir <em>Thomas Baines</em>, came from <em>Florence</em>
to Complement the Ambassador, and
immediately dispatched away a Courier to
the Grand Duke about the Salute; who referred
the whole Affair to the Governor: and
he making a Protest that he was ready to pay
all the respect which was due to the Ambassador's
Character and Quality, upon the fore-mentioned
Pretensions, six days, after our
arrival, absolutely refused to Salute the Ship
first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Livorne</em> is the great Magazine of Trade for
the <em>Levant</em>, being a free Port: Merchants of
all Countries residing here, <em>Armenians</em> especially,
and <em>Jews</em>; which latter enjoy great Priviledges,
without wearing any distinct Mark
in their Hats or Habits, whereby they may
be known. They are allow'd the publick
Exercise of their Religion: their Synagogue
large and handsome. The Port inward has
a <em>Mole</em> for the Duke's Galleys and other small
Vessels to ride in: the Entrance of which is
chained up every Night. Hard by is the
Statue of Duke <em>Ferdinand</em> in Marble, raised
upon an high Pedestal; under which are four
Slaves in Brass, in different Postures, very
large, and above the ordinary proportion,
but done with exquisite and admirable Art.
Two Castles to the Seaward well fortified:
the Town Walls very high, and the four
Gates strongly guarded: below which is a
Ditch of about fifteen or twenty yards over,
and very deep. No Stranger is allowed to
view the Works, nor Souldier permitted to
come out of the Castles. About four thousand
Slaves are there, as the Merchants told
us, who are lockt up in the <em>Bagno</em> every
Night. The <em>Piazza</em>, where the Merchants
meet, is adorned with Marble Pillars, which
sustain the Porticos: at the East end of
which is the great Church whose Roof appears
very glorious, having several Circles
richly gilded and painted with curious Figures.</p>

<p>The broad Street is paved between two
and three yards on each side with Free-stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>27. In the Afternoon we weighed out of
<em>Livorne</em> Road, and sailed by the Islands <em>Gorgonia</em>
and <em>Capraria</em>, seeing <em>Corsica</em> at a distance.</p>

<p>28. We lay beating at Sea all this Day,
the Wind being contrary.</p>

<p>29. This Day we were forced back, the
contrary Winds still continuing.</p>

<p>30. We weighed a second time, and sailed
by three small Islands, <em>Capraria</em>, <em>Planasia</em>, and
<em>Monte Christi</em>. We saw also <em>Gigio</em> and <em>Sanuti</em>,
two other small Islands near the Main: but
we made but little way, by reason of ill
Weather for 4 or 5 Days.</p>

<p><em>Novemb. 5.</em> At Evening we saw the Eruptions
of Fire from <em>Stromboli</em>, which lies to the
N. W. of <em>Sicily</em>. Sometimes it flamed very
bright Light as a <em>Beacon</em>, at other times there
appeared only a glorious kind of Light, like
that of an ordinary Star when the Air is
thick and hazy. They say that it flames most
in rainy Weather.</p>

<p>6. In the Morning we were up within a
League of it, and plainly perceived it to
smoke. It is of a round figure, and, as we
gathered, may be about three or four Miles
in compass. It bore W. by S. of us. Not
far from it lye scattered several other Islands,
called by the Ancients <em>Æoliœ</em> and <em>Vulcaniœ</em>:
among which are <em>Lipara</em>, a long flattish Island,
and <em>Vulcanello</em>, which smokes most. This
Afternoon we came to an Anchor in eight
Fathom Water in the <em>Phare</em> of <em>Messina</em>, in
the mid Stream between <em>Scylla</em> and <em>Charybdis</em>:
a violent and strong Current setting against
us, and the Wind not high enough, so as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
be able to stemm it. The breadth of the
<em>Strait</em> from <em>Messina</em> to <em>Rhegium</em> may be about a
League. The Land is very high on the <em>Calabrian</em>
side, where are very steep Rocks, and
great depth of Water, above 150 Fathom,
as they told us: but on the <em>Sicilian</em> side, near
<em>Charybdis</em> Shole-water, and usually an Eddy.
On the Sandy Banks stands the Phare or
Watch-tower. Several Currents meeting in
this narrow Passage, cause a great rippling of
the Water: and great quantity of Water
coming in, as the Winds drive, in great quantity
meeting with the Shole, is broken into
Waves. The Eddies here are caused by the
meeting of the different Currents by which
the Waters are sometimes carried N. and
sometimes S. the great danger is, lest they
drive the Ship on either side. We have
had Lightning for seven or eight Nights together.</p>

<p>7. We sail'd by <em>Ætna</em>, now called <em>Mongibel</em>,
where the Sea widens ten or eleven
Leagues over. Now we see plainly the Smoke
briskly issuing out of the <em>Crater</em>, the <em>Limbus</em>
of which was all black. The uppermost part
of the Mountain was covered with Snow,
except some streaks of Ashes, as we judge,
which lie as it were in a Gutter, spread here
and there.</p>

<p>8. We espied a <em>Saettia</em> at about 3 Leagues
distance, and making up to her, found her
forsaken. The Captain sent several Seamen
on board, and carried the Vessel to <em>Smyrna</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Scanty Wind for several Days: and the
Lightning still continued.</p>

<p>13. We were up with <em>Cape Modona</em>, the
Southernmost Cape of the <em>Morea</em>, and sailed
by <em>Coron</em>. The Land very high, the Hills of
<em>Arcadia</em> lying Eastward from us. The Weather
excessive hot at this time, as it is in
<em>England</em> at <em>Midsummer</em>. We espied from
our Maintop-mast five Sail of great Ships,
which we supposed to be <em>Tripolines</em>, who did
not think fit to come up and speak with us.
But afterward we heard for certain, that
they were part of the <em>Venetian</em> Fleet.</p>

<p>14. We lay for the most part becalmed over
against <em>Cape Matapan</em>: but in the Evening the
Wind blowing fresh, we sailed between the
Island of <em>Cerigo</em> and the Main Land of <em>Greece</em>;
it being about three Leagues over to <em>Cape
Angelo</em>.</p>

<p>15. We entred the Arches, and steered
through the North Channel, leaving <em>Melo</em>
and <em>Antimelo</em> on the Starboard-quarter, at
some Leagues distance.</p>

<p>16. Betimes in the Morning we were
athwart <em>Negropont</em>, and sailed between it
and <em>Andros</em>. The <em>Bocca</em> lies S. W. and N. E.</p>

<p>17. We sailed by <em>Chios</em> or <em>Scio</em>, which is
very mountainous toward the middle. It is
about four Leagues distant from <em>Cape Caraboroun</em>,
or the <em>Cape of the black Nose</em>, as the
<em>Turkish</em> word signifies, which the Seamen, in
their usual way of corrupting Names, call
<em>Cape Jobbernoule</em>, the <em>Corinœum</em> of the Ancients,
a Promontory of the famous Mountain
<em>Mimas</em>, which runs along the Southern side
of the <em>Bay of Smyrna</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>This Day the <em>Smyrna</em> Fleet from <em>England</em>
comes up to us very luckily, to our great Satisfaction
and Joy.</p>

<p>18. We are now got into the <em>Bay of Smyrna</em>,
and come to an Anchor without the
Castle, not far from St. <em>Jacomo's Point</em>, as
the Seamen call it, or rather <em>Sangiac Point</em>.
In the Afternoon the Consul, with several
Gentlemen of the Factory, came to wait
upon my Lord Ambassador, and desired his
Lordship to defer his Entrance into <em>Smyrna</em>
till the Twentieth, that he might be received
with greater Honour. That Evening
we heard a great howling of <em>Jackalls</em> upon
the Hills.</p>

<p>20. The Consul with the Nation, accompanied
with his <em>Druggermen</em> and <em>Janizaries</em> in
their <em>Habit</em>, together with several <em>French</em>,
<em>Dutch</em> and <em>Genoese</em> Merchants, residing in that
famous Emporium, came to the Village
near the Castle, who there expected us
with Horses. Upon our going ashore,
the <em>Leopard</em> fired fifty one Guns. We made
about 140 Horse; and immediately upon our
setting forth, we rode for about three Miles
together under the Hill to the S. W. of <em>Smyrna</em>;
the places adjoyning set thick with
Olive, Fig, and Almond-trees. Afterwards
we clambered over some rocky Ascents; but
the Horses of the Country being sure-footed,
we were in no danger of falling. Some little way
we were forced to ride on the Sea-shore, and
soon after came to the Jews burying place,
whose Monuments lie flat upon the ground.
As soon as we entred into the City, we found
the Streets full of <em>Greeks</em>, <em>Armenians</em>, <em>Turks</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and <em>Jews</em>, whom Curiosity had drawn together
to see and observe our Cavalcade; the
<em>English</em> Ships, which were in the <em>Bay</em>, firing
their Guns, as we past near the Shore. And
so after three hours riding the Ambassador
was brought to the Consul's House, where
Lodgings were provided for him. During
our stay we met with not only kind, but very
noble Entertainment from the worthy Gentlemen
of the Factory.</p>

<p><em>Decemb. 8.</em> We took our leave of <em>Smyrna</em>,
being accompanied by the Consul and Merchants
on board the <em>London-Merchant</em>, Capt.
<em>John Hill</em> Commander, the <em>Leopard</em> being ordered
to go no further than <em>Smyrna</em>, it being
feared in <em>England</em>, that if she had sailed up
to <em>Constantinople</em>, the <em>Turks</em> might have press'd
her for their Service in <em>Candia</em>, which they
were then besieging.</p>

<p>9. This Morning we weighed betimes,
and sailed between <em>Scio</em> and <em>Mytilene</em>. But
on the</p>

<p>10. We were forced back near the long
Island within the Bay, being unwilling to go
to <em>Scio</em>, the <em>Tripolines</em> and <em>Turkish</em> Galleys lying
there. Here we lay ten Days, expecting
a fair Wind.</p>

<p>20. The Wind coming about and favouring
us, we sailed a second time between <em>Scio</em> and
<em>Mytilene</em>.</p>

<p>21. We past by <em>Lemnos</em>, and were up with
the Island <em>Tenedos</em>; a fine Champaign Country,
only with one Hill toward the middle
of it. The Castle to the N. E. part of the
Isle: over against which lye three small
Islands in a strait Line. Here we came to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Anchor. We saw the Ruins of <em>Troas</em> at a
distance, but did not think it safe to go ashore.</p>

<p>22. The Wind coming about at S. we entred
the <em>Hellespont</em>, which may be about two
Leagues and a half over. The Castles built
upon the opposite points of Land, about 11
or 12 Years before, after the great Defeat
given the <em>Turkish Armata</em> at the <em>Dardanels</em> by
the <em>Venetians</em>; <em>Cape Janizary</em> on the <em>Asian</em>
side; which, with the <em>Philæum</em>, makes a tolerable
good Bay for ordinary Vessels. The
narrowest Strait of the <em>Hellespont</em> is at the two
other Castles, distant about six Leagues,
where it may be about ¾ of a Mile wide.
These the <em>Christians</em> call the <em>Dardanelli</em>; at
which are situate the Towns, <em>Sestus</em> and <em>Abydus</em>,
famous in <em>Greek</em> Poesie. These Castles
we saluted with our Guns and Trumpets, as
we did the first: but each, whether out of
Pride, or out of Covetousness, to save the
<em>Grand Signior</em>'s Powder, return'd us no more
than two Guns. The Wind blowing very fair
we sailed into the <em>Propontis</em>.</p>

<p>23. We passed by St. <em>Stephano's Point</em>, where
we had a full view of the S. E. Angle of <em>Constantinople</em>,
which being situated upon several
Hills to a mighty advantage, what with
the Cypress-Trees intermixed, and what
with the gilded Spires of the <em>Moschs</em>, yielded
us a very diverting glorious Prospect.
Passing by the <em>Seraglio Point</em>, which we saluted
by a discharge of several Guns, in the
mid Stream between it and the <em>Tophana</em>, we
came to an Anchor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>26. On St. <em>Stephen</em>'s Day the Ambassador
landed at <em>Galata</em>, (having before been visited
by the Earl of <em>Winchelsea</em>, and the Merchants
residing there) and was received there
by the <em>Chiaus Basha</em> and the <em>Vaivod</em> of <em>Galata</em>,
the <em>Janizaries</em> and <em>Chiauses</em> attending, and
was waited upon by them to his Palace: and
soon after the <em>Kaimacam</em>, or Governor of
<em>Constantinople</em>, sent an Officer to Complement
him upon his Arrival; the <em>Grand Signior</em>
being then at <em>Larissa</em> in <em>Thessaly</em>.</p>

<p><em>January 2.</em> The Ambassadors, Old and
New, went over to <em>Constantinople</em>, that Morning
being assigned by the <em>Kaimacam</em> to give
them Audience, the <em>Chiaus Basha</em> and other
Officers attending at the Water-side to receive
them; Horses being brought thither
for them and their Followers to mount.
This <em>Kaimakam Jusuph</em>, a little old Man,
had formerly been a Page of the Chamber,
and chief Falconer, and afterwards <em>Basha</em>
of <em>Silistria</em>. He entertained the Ambassadors
and their Company with Perfumes,
Coffee, and Sherbet, and distributed about
fifteen <em>Koftans Orrests</em> among them: after
about an Hours stay they took their
leave.</p>

<p>Being upon the Coasts of <em>Greece</em> about
<em>August</em> or <em>September</em> 69. in the Latitude of
35°. 53´. we found by our <em>Azimouth</em> Compass,
that we had Westerly variation there
5°. 22´.</p>

<p>The variety of Colours of the Sea-Water
at several times chiefly depends upon
the Wind and Weather, and the reflexion
of the Light upon it. It's usual and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
natural Colour is a deep Green: but in
Cloudy and Rainy Weather, the Surface of
the Water appears blackish. On the <em>Goodwins</em>
upon the Tide of Flood, the Water
was white, the Waves by reason of the Shallows,
meeting with opposition, and breaking
into Foam, till the Flood is well advanced.
Sometimes the Water is of a perfect
Azure colour, as we observed for several
Weeks in the <em>Mediterranean</em>. The Sun shining
bright upon the Water, sometimes the
upper part of the Waves appears Purplish,
sometimes Reddish; though in Shallows perchance
it may receive this latter Tincture
also from the Sands which lie under it. When
the Wind has freshened, and the Ship has
been under full Sail, I have observed the
Waves to the head, and at the sides of
the Ship, to appear with a pale kind of
brightness: and at <em>Malaga</em>, and at my return,
going on board our Ship, which lay
about half a League from the shore, at Night,
the Wind then at East, the Boats Crew letting
their Oar fall roughly into the Water,
diverted us as it were with the sight
of a continued Flame, raised by their rowing;
which I ascribe rather to the Saline
Particles of the Sea-Water, which were
then put into a violent Agitation, than to
the Spawn of Fish, as some of our Company
imagined.</p>

<p>Sailing toward the West of <em>Portland</em>, we
saw several <em>Porpisces</em> playing with their
Heads above Water; which I mention only,
because the Seamen look upon them as
fore-runners of a Storm; the Wind soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
after blowing very hard at North by East.
And afterwards arriving at <em>Constantinople</em>,
the Wind blowing a stiff Gale at North, I
observed with a pleasing kind of astonishment
good part of the <em>Propontis</em>, that is,
from the <em>Seraglio Point</em> toward the Islands,
which lye against the <em>Bay of Nicomedia</em>, Eastward
and South-East from us, as far as we
could see, covered as it were with <em>Porpisces</em>,
which appeared every where in great
abundance. So that I am very apt to believe
that <em>Julius Solinus</em> in <em>Chap.</em> 12. of his
<em>Polykister</em> is to be understood of <em>Porpisces</em>,
and not of <em>Dolphins</em>, now properly so called,
though that be his Word, speaking
of the <em>Bosphorus</em> and <em>Propontis</em>: <em>Hæc profunda
Delphinas plurimos habent</em>: and soon after,
<em>ante omnia nihil velocius habent maria,
sic ut plerunque transvolent vela navium</em>.
I could not hear that any <em>Dolphins</em> are
caught in those Seas by the <em>Greeks</em>, whose
Poverty, added to the love which their Nation
has for Fish, and the advantage arising
thence, upon the account of their solemn
Fasts and Abstinences from all Flesh,
even to a wonderful strictness and scrupulosity,
has made them excellent Fishermen:
nor did I ever see any in their Fish-Markets,
or see one of them brought to the
Ambassador's Table by the Proveditor for
curiosity: Though otherwise it is an excellently
well tasted Fish, especially when
soused. I allow, that they will swim very
swiftly, as do the <em>Porpisces</em>; and that they
will follow a Ship for several Leagues together:
but then they Swim somewhat deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
in the Water, sometimes are catch'd,
though not often. The Seamen have reached
them with a Fisgig, a kind of barbed
Iron, at the End of a Pole tied fast to a
Rope, and have made good Chear with
them. But this is only my Conjecture, with
which I end my Journal.</p>

<h2><em>Historical Observations relating to
<strong>Constantinople</strong>. By the Reverend
and Learned <strong>Tho. Smith</strong>,
D. D. Fellow of <strong>Magd. Coll.
Oxon.</strong> and of the <strong>Royal Society</strong>.</em></h2>


<p><em>Constantinople</em>, formerly <em>Byzantium</em>, was<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
by <em>Constantine</em> the Great, called so after
his own Name, who being mightily pleased
with the beautiful and advantageous situation
of the Place between two Seas, and
defended by narrow Streights on both sides,
removed the Seat of the Empire hither, and
laid the foundation of its future Splendor
and Greatness. It was also by a<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>special
Edict or Law of the same Emperor, which
he caused to be engraven on a Marble Pillar,
placed near his own Statue on Horse-back,
in one of the Piazza's of his new built
City called <em>Strategium</em>, where the Soldiers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>used to Muster, as in the <em>Campus Martius</em>,
called <em>second or new Rome</em>, in emulation of
old <em>Rome</em>, which he designed and endeavoured
this should equal in all things. Accordingly
he endowed it with the same Priviledges
and Immunities, and established
the same number of Magistrates and Orders
of People, and divided the whole extent
of it into fourteen Precincts or<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>Regions,
according to the division of <em>Rome</em>. And
the <em>Greek</em> Writers were as elegant and extravagant
in their commendations of it; but the
usual Title in their ordinary Discourses and
Writings, when they had occasion to mention
it without any flourish, was ἡ βασιλευούσα,
ἡ βασιλίς, that is, the Imperial City, to the
same sense with that of<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><em>Sidonius Apollinaris</em>,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Salve sceptrorum columen, Regina orientis,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Orbis Roma tui.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The Country about it was afterwards called
<em>Romania</em> in a limited and restrained sense,
(for that <em>Romania</em> was anciently the same with
<em>orbis Romanus</em>, seems clear from<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><em>Epiphanius</em>)
and the People Ρωμαῖοι. But I suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>this was not done till about the middle times
of the Empire, when it began to decline.
The <em>Greeks</em> still retain this Name. For if
you ask any of the <em>Greeks</em> born upon the
Continent of <em>Thrace</em>, what Country Man he
is? he answers forthwith, Ρωμαῖος <em>Romios</em>, for
so they pronounce it. The <em>Turks</em> in like
manner call a <em>Greek</em> Christian <em>Urum Gaour</em>, or
the Roman Infidel, as they will call sometimes
the Emperor of <em>Germany</em>, <em>Urumler Padisha</em>
or Emperor of the <em>Romans</em>. Hence it
was, that the latter <em>Græcian</em> Emperors stiled
themselves βασιλεῖς Ρωμαίων, Kings of the Romans,
that is, such as were Born in <em>Romania</em>
and the other Countries, which made up the
Eastern division of the Empire. Tho' perchance
by this flourishing Title they pretended
a right to the Government of the West:
Upon which vain presumption they assumed
also the Title of Κοσμοκράτορες, or Emperors of
the World, as if they had been the true Successors
of <em>Augustus</em>, and the Western Emperors,
Usurpers, whom they called by way of
contempt and indignation, Ρῆγες, Reges, as<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
<em>Luitprandus</em> informs us in the accompt of his
Embassy to <em>Nicephorus Phocas</em>, and afforded the
People of <em>Italy</em> no other Title than that of<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><em>Longobards</em>
or <em>Lombards</em>. The present <em>Greeks</em> call
all the Western Christians Λατῖνοι or φράγγοι
<em>Latins</em> or <em>Franks</em>, the <em>Turks</em> only making use of
the latter, when they speak civilly of us, and
calling <em>Christendom</em> <em>Phrenkistan</em>, in the present
<em>Greek</em> φραγγία. The <em>Turks</em> now as proudly call
<em>Constantinople</em> <em>Alem pena</em>, or the refuge of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>World: Where indeed seems to be a medley
of all or most Nations of three parts of it,
and of all Religions, which are allowed to
be publickly profest and exercised every
where throughout the Empire, except the
<em>Persian</em>. For they look upon it as a corruption
of, and deviation from the Rules and
Doctrine of <em>Mahomet</em>, their great false Prophet,
and therefore absolutely forbid it, as
repugnant to, and destructive of the Doctrine
of Life and Salvation, as they speak. And
accordingly they condemn with all imaginable
fury the Professors of it, who pretend to
follow <em>Ali</em>, as Sectaries and Apostates, and
entertain worse Opinions of them, than of
<em>Christians</em>, or <em>Jews</em> or <em>Infidels</em>. The <em>Persians</em>
are not behind-hand with them in their hatred
and disrespect, deriding them as gross
and stupid, and looking upon them as little
less than barbarous; Interest and Zeal for
their several Tenets heightning their differences
so much, that in time of War they destroy
one anothers <em>Moschs</em>. I remember, that
there was a great Discourse in <em>Constantinople</em>
among the <em>Turks</em> concerning an impudent
hot-headed <em>Persian</em>, who publickly in the new
<em>Mosch</em> built by the Mother of the present
Emperor, asserted that <em>Ali</em> was equal to <em>Mahomet</em>.
But it seems he very luckily made his
escape out of their Hands, at which the
Priests and the more zealous <em>Turks</em> were very
much scandalized.</p>

<p>The <em>Greeks</em> have twenty six Churches within
the Walls of the City, besides 6 in <em>Galata</em>, of
which I have given an Account elsewhere.
They have also two Churches at <em>Scutari</em>, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
at <em>Kadikui</em> or <em>Chalcedon</em>. So at <em>Staurosis</em>, <em>Chingilkui</em>,
and several other Villages upon the
Asian Shore off the Bosphorus, as at <em>Beshictash</em>,
<em>Ortakui</em>, <em>Chorouch chesme</em>, which Church is dedicated
to St. <em>Michal</em> the Archangel, <em>Jenikui</em>
or <em>Neochorion</em>, <em>Therapia</em>, <em>Bujukdere</em>, and other
Villages on the <em>European</em> side. They have
also a Church at <em>Haskui</em>, where is their Burying
place, and another near the <em>Bagnio</em>,
dedicated to St. <em>Parasceve</em>. And at <em>Tatoula</em>
about a Mile from <em>Pera</em>, upon a Hill, which
from the Name of the Church is thence called
by the <em>Greeks</em> and <em>Franks</em>, St. <em>Demetrius</em> his Hill.
Next to the holy Virgin, St. <em>Demetrius</em> and
St. <em>George</em> have most Churches dedicated to
them.</p>

<p>The <em>Armenians</em> have not, if I remember aright,
above seven Churches; they being few
in number in comparison of the <em>Greeks</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Jews</em> may have in the City and places
adjacent between twenty and thirty Synagogues,
this being the greatest shelter of that
accursed contemptible People in the Grand
Signiors Dominions, next to <em>Caire</em> and <em>Saloniki</em>:
and I believe there may be about twenty or
thirty thousand families of them. They are
of great use and service to the <em>Turks</em>, upon
accompt of their Brocage and Merchandise,
and Industry in several mechanical Trades.
All these I look upon as Natives, or Slaves rather,
each paying mony for his Head every
year. The <em>Jews</em> indeed very wisely collect
this Tax among themselves, and according to
an agreement made with the <em>Teftardar</em> or
Treasurer, pay a certain sum in gross for their
whole Nation residing there: by which piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of cunning they are great gainers, and spare
the poor among them less able to pay, by a
contribution of the rich to make up the sum.
The <em>English</em> and <em>Dutch</em> Ambassadors have their
Chappels in their Palaces common to their respective
Nations.</p>

<p>The Churches and Chappels of the Western
<em>Christians</em> of the <em>Roman</em> Communion in <em>Galata</em>,
are</p>

<p>St. <em>Peters</em>, belonging to the <em>Dominicans</em>,
where is the famous piece of <em>Madonna di Constantinopolis</em>
as the <em>Italians</em> call it, or of the
blessed Virgin, holding the holy Child <em>Jesus</em>
in her arms: which they pretend to be drawn
by the hand of St. <em>Luke</em>, celebrated by some
of the latter Ecclesiastical Writers to have
been a famous Painter. Out of respect to this
idle tradition the credulous and superstitious
<em>Latins</em> and <em>Greeks</em> of the <em>Roman</em> Communion
shew great veneration to it, which otherwise
hath little in it of proportion, art, or beauty,
to derive any reputation upon the designer, or
upon his work.</p>

<p>St. <em>Francis</em>, belonging to the <em>Conventuali</em>,
Friars of the order of St. <em>Francis</em>; the ground
of this by the wise conduct and intercession of
<em>Caviliere Molino</em>, the Venetian <em>Bailo</em>, after the
surrender of <em>Candia</em>, upon the Peace made by
the Republick with the Grand Signior, was
procured to be restored, and a handsome
Church rebuilt with the large contributions
of mony sent out of <em>Christendom</em>.</p>

<p>St. <em>Benedict</em>, belonging to the <em>Jesuits</em>, where
is a rich Altar curiously adorn'd with several
figures in <em>Mosiack</em>. This Convent was purchased
for them by their great Benefactor,
<em>Henry</em> the fourth of <em>France</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>St. <em>Mary</em>, belonging to the <em>Observantines</em> or
<em>Zoccolanti</em>, a branch of the order of St. <em>Francis</em>,
so called from their going in <em>Zoccoli</em> or wooden
clogs.</p>

<p>The <em>Capuchines</em> have a little Chappel dedicated
to St. <em>George</em>, hard by the <em>French</em> Ambassadors
Palace.</p>

<p>St. <em>Ann</em>, a Chappel frequented by the
<em>Perotes</em>.</p>

<p>St. <em>Paul</em> and St. <em>Anthony</em>, were both taken
away some years since from the <em>Christians</em>, and
turned into <em>Moschs</em>. The former of which is
now known by the name of <em>Arab Giamesi</em>, or
the Mosch of the <em>Arabians</em>. Our Interpreters
mentioned also to me the Church of St. <em>John</em>,
which the <em>Turks</em> have seized upon for their use,
St. <em>George</em>, which the <em>Jews</em> are possest of, and
St. <em>Sebastian</em>, which was used to be visited
chiefly on Holy days.</p>

<p>The North-wind blows for the most part at
<em>Constantinople</em>. Which must be ascribed to its
nearness to the <em>Euxine</em> Sea, which bears that
point from it. So that for want of a Southwardly
wind Ships have been forced to lye a
month or two sometimes near the mouth of
the <em>Hellespont</em>. This was taken notice of long
since by <em>Eunapius</em> in the life of <em>Ædesius</em>, who
ascribes the seldom blowing of the <em>South</em>
wind to the situation of the mountains, whereas
it is checked and overpowered by the exuberance
of the Vapours continually sent forth
from the <em>black</em> and <em>great Sea</em>, as the <em>Greeks</em> call
it in comparison of the <em>Mediterranean</em>. <em>Vide
ad finem Codini de origin. Constantinopol. Edit.
Paris. Pag. 80.</em></p>

<p>The <em>Hellespont</em> is about forty miles in length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and at the Castles of <em>Sestos</em> and <em>Abydos</em>
the streight may be about three quarters of
an English mile over, or less.</p>

<p>The length of the <em>Propontis</em> is about a hundred
and fifty miles, both shores may be seen
in the middle of it. In it are,</p>

<p><em>Cyzicus</em>, an Island near the <em>Asian</em> shore, to
which it is joined by two bridges. It still retains
its ancient name Κυζικὸ, and is the seat
of a Bishop, being inhabited by a considerable
number of <em>Greeks</em>.</p>

<p><em>Proconnesus</em>, not far from the former; now,
as for some centuries past, called <em>Marmora</em>,
from the excellent quarries of Marble there
found, the marmor <em>Cyzenicum</em> also being famous
in the time of <em>Pliny</em>.</p>

<p><em>Besbychus</em>, now called by the Greek καλόλιμνο,
or the good haven, not far from the entrance
into the bay of <em>Montanea</em> to the North and by
East. The <em>Turks</em> call it <em>Imralme</em>.</p>

<p>There are several Islands over against the
bay of <em>Nicomedia</em>, formerly called <em>Sinus Astacenus</em>,
according to <em>Strabo</em>, about six or seven
leagues from <em>Constantinople</em>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><em>Prote</em>, so called because they approach first to
it, coming from <em>Constantinople</em>; to the South
of this <em>Prencipe</em> and <em>Pytis</em>, which I take to be
the same with <em>Pyrgos</em>, that lyes inmost toward
the bay: <em>Chalcitis</em>, in modern Greek, <em>Chalce</em>
or <em>Chalcis</em>. <em>Oxia</em> and <em>Platy</em> to the North-west.
I have expressed the <em>Turkish</em> names of the lesser
and uninhabited islands elsewhere, which perchance
were phantastically imposed by some
<em>Franks</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Seraglio</em> is at the extreme point of the
North-east Angle of <em>Constantinople</em>, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
formerly stood old <em>Byzantium</em>, within which
towards the Haven is a stately <em>Kiosk</em> or summer
house, from whence the <em>Grand Signior</em> usually
takes Barge, when he passes into <em>Asia</em>,
or diverts himself upon the <em>Bosphorus</em>, at which
time the <em>Bostangi Bashi</em>, who hath the principal
care of the Emperors palace, and hath the
command of the <em>Bosphorus</em>, sits at the helm
and steers.</p>

<p>The seven Towers are at the South-east extremity.</p>

<p>The only Suburbs are to the North-west,
along the Haven-side; for above the hill,
where the three walls begin, lies an open
champaign Country, except that here and
there at considerable distances farm houses
are scatter'd.</p>

<p>The Haven runs in from the West, and so
opens East.</p>

<p>At the East end of <em>Galata</em> is <em>Tophana</em>, where
they cast their great Guns.</p>

<p><em>Pera</em> and <em>Galata</em> have about six gates to
the Seaward. The whole tract of ground was
anciently, before the times of the Emperor
<em>Valentinian</em>, who enclosed and fortified <em>Galata</em>
with walls and towers, styled Περαῖα or
Regio <em>Peræa</em> being πέραν τῆς πόλεως, on the other
side of the City to the North, which is the
reason of its name, seated on higher hills, and
whose ascent is more steep and difficult.</p>

<p>Our modern <em>Geographers</em>, such as <em>Mercator</em>
and <em>Ortelius</em>, who herein follow <em>Ptolomy</em>, place
<em>Constantinople</em> in the Latitude of 43. degrees
and 5 minutes: the <em>Arabian</em> and <em>Persian Astronomers</em>,
as <em>Abulfeda</em>, <em>Nassir Edin</em>, <em>Vlugh Beigh</em>,
and so the πρόχειροι κανόνες, <em>Chrysococcas</em> transla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>ted
out of the <em>Persian</em> tables, place it more
Northerly in 45. But by latter and better
observation it is found, that they have erred
in assigning the Latitude of this City, as of
several other places. To salve these differences,
there is no just ground of pretence to say,
that the <em>Poles</em> are moveable and have changed
their situation since their time, whereas it
may better be imputed to their want of due
care, or to their taking things upon trust,
from the reports of <em>Travellers</em> and <em>Seamen</em>, not
having been upon the places themselves:
which certainly is to be said for <em>Ptolomy</em> whose
observations, as to places more remote from
<em>Alexandria</em>, are far from being accurate and
true. The learned Mr. <em>John Greaves</em>, as I
find in a Manuscript discourse, very worthy
of being Printed, which he presented to the
most reverend and renowned <em>Arch-bishop Usher</em>,
took the height of the <em>Pole</em> at <em>Constantinople</em>
with a brass sextant of above 4 feet <em>radius</em>,
and found it to be but 41 degrees 6´. but by
the observation we made in our Court-yard
at <em>Pera</em> with a very good <em>Quadrant</em> we found
it but 40 degrees and 58 minutes of North
Latitude.</p>

<p>There is no place between the <em>Propontis</em> and
the walls of the City, except just at the Seraglio-point,
which may be two hundred paces
in length; where they have raised on a platform
a battery for Great guns; but from the
point to the end of the Haven West, the space
to the gates is unequal in some places about
twenty paces broad, in others three or four
times as many more.</p>

<p>The distance between <em>Constantinople</em> and <em>Chal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>cedon</em>
upon the opposite <em>Bythinian</em>-shore may be
about three or four miles.</p>

<p>In the Walls are engraven the Names of several
Emperors, who reigned toward the declension
of the <em>Græcian</em> Empire, as <em>Theophilus</em>,
<em>Michael</em>, <em>Basilius</em>, <em>Constantius Porphyrogenitus</em>,
by whose care, and at whose expence the several
breaches caused in them by the Sea or
by Earthquakes, were repaired.</p>

<p><em>Kumkapi</em> or the sand-gate lies toward the
<em>Propontis</em>; this the <em>Greeks</em> call in their vulgar
language Κονδοσκάλι, <em>Contoscalium</em>, or the little
scale or landing-place. Here formerly was
an Arsenal for Gallies and other small vessels;
it being a convenient passage over Sea. Over
this Gate was anciently engraven a curious
Inscription still preserved in that excellent
collection published by<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><em>Gruterus</em>.</p>

<p><em>Jedicula Kapi</em>, or the Gate of the seven
Towers, so called from its nearness to that
<em>Acropolis</em>, is that, I guess, which the <em>Greeks</em>
formerly called χρυσῆ or the Golden Gate, and
by some late <em>Latin</em> Writers <em>Chrysea</em>, in <em>Luitprandus</em>,
<em>Carea</em>, by a mistake either of the
Transcriber or Printer, for <em>Aurea</em>, for so certainly
it must be mended. Over this Gate was
this inscription,</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Hæc loca Theudosius decorat post fata Tyranni,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Aurea secla gerit, qui portam construit auro.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>cited by <em>Sirmond</em> in his notes upon<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><em>Sidonius</em>.
This Gate is in the twelfth Region, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>also called ὡραῖα from its beautiful and curious
structure.</p>

<p>The Gun gate formerly called Roman gate,
not because it leads towards the continent of
<em>Romania</em> or <em>Thrace</em>, but from<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>St. <em>Romanus</em>,
where the last Christian Emperor was killed
at the assault which the <em>Turks</em> made to force
their Way into the City by it.</p>

<p>Near <em>Adrianople</em> gate is a fair large <em>Mosch</em>
called <em>Ali-bassa</em>, upon a hill accounted the highest
in the City.</p>

<p>The distance between tower and tower in
the upper wall to the landward may be about
ninety of my paces; the space between that
and the second wall about eighteen paces over.</p>

<p>The place, where the <em>Lyons</em>, <em>Leopards</em>, and
such like wild creatures are kept, (where I
saw also several <em>Jackalls</em>) was formerly, as
the <em>Greeks</em> told me, a Christian Church dedicated
to Παναγία or the Blessed Virgin, where
this Verse is still legible,</p>

<p class="center">Κατὰ Σκυθῶν ἔπνευσας θερμὸν ἐν μάχαις.
</p>

<p>There is no tide or running back of the water
on any side of the <em>Bosphorus</em> into the black
Sea, as<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>some have imagined, whose mistake
might possibly arise hence, that the wind being
at North, and blowing hard, the current
sets more violently at such times against the
several headlands jetting out into the channel,
which admits of several turnings, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>so the waters are forced back to some little
distance: or else because when the South-wind
freshens and grows boisterous, it makes a
high rolling Sea in the <em>Propontis</em> and <em>Bosphorous</em>,
and being contrary to the current, gives a
check to it, so that it becomes less sensible,
and is easily stemmed. Where it is narrowest,
the distance seems to the eye to be scarce a
mile over from one shore to another; where
broadest, not much above a mile and a half,
unless where it runs into the deep Bays,
which by reason of their shallowness only harbour
Boats.</p>

<p>The channel certainly is natural and not
cut by art, as some have idly fansied, not considering,
how the <em>Euxine</em> Sea should discharge it
self otherwise of those great quantities of waters,
poured into it by the <em>Ister</em> and <em>Tanais</em>,
now called <em>Don</em>, and the other Rivers, whereby
it becomes less salt, even very sensibly to the
taste, than several parts of the <em>Mediterranean</em>.</p>

<p>The Fish, by a strange kind of instinct, pass
in vast shoals twice a year, Autumn and
Spring, through the <em>Bosphorus</em>, that is, out of
one Sea into another, of which the <em>Greeks</em>,
who live several months of the year upon them,
take great numbers, and supply the markets
at easie rates; the Cormorants and other ravenous
water-fowl, which the <em>Turks</em> will not
suffer to be destroy'd or otherwise molested,
preying upon them.</p>

<p>The weather in some months is very inconstant,
great heats and colds happening the
same day upon the change of the wind.</p>

<p>The winters at <em>Constantinople</em> are sometimes
extraordinary severe. I have heard it related
by several old <em>Greeks</em>, as a thing most certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
that the <em>Bosphorus</em> was frozen over in the time
of <em>Achmed</em>, and that a Hare was coursed over
it. It hapned thus, that upon a thaw huge
cakes of Ice came floating down the <em>Danube</em>
into the black Sea, and were driven by the
current into the <em>Bosphorus</em>, whereupon the return
of the frost, they were fixed so hard that
it became passable. In the year 1669 there
was Ice in the Haven to the great amazement
of the <em>Turks</em>; and some were so frighted at
this unusual accident, that they lookt upon
it as a dismal prodigy, and concluded, that
the World would be at an end that Year.
The <em>Aguglia</em> or <em>Obelisk</em> in the <em>Hippodrome</em> is
betwixt fifty and sixty Foot high.</p>

<p>The Historical Pillar in <em>basso relievo</em>, raised
in honour of the Emperors <em>Arcadius</em> and <em>Honorius</em>,
may be in height about an hundred
seven and forty feet.</p>

<p><em>Alexius Comnenus</em> lies buried in the Patriarchal
Church against the wall, and his daughter
<em>Anna Comnena</em>, the Historian, who lived
about the year of Christ 1117. They pretend
to shew there the reliques of St. <em>Anastasia</em>,
who suffered Martyrdom under the Emperor
<em>Valerianus</em>, and of St. <em>Euphemia</em>, Virgin and
Martyr, who lost her life most gloriously for
<em>Christ's</em> holy religion at <em>Chalcedon</em> under <em>Dioclesian</em>.</p>

<p>In <em>Sancta Sophia</em> there are pillars so great, that
a Man can scarce fathom them at twice. At
the end of the Gallery, that joins the other
two, each about thirty of my paces wide,
there is a piece of transparent Marble, two
or three Inches thick. In the North gallery
upon the Pavement is a reddish sort of a Mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>ble
Stone, brought, as the <em>Turks</em> and <em>Christians</em>
relate, from <em>Palestine</em>, on which they Fable,
that the blessed Virgin used to wash the linnen
of our Saviour.</p>

<p>I observed but one step from the Body of
the Church to the <em>Bema</em> or place where the
Altar formerly stood.</p>

<p>The great <em>Mosch</em> at <em>Chasim-bassa</em> on <em>Pera</em>
side to the West, was formerly a Church dedicated
to St <em>Theodosia</em>.</p>

<p><em>Gianghir</em>, a Mosch so called, upon a hill at
<em>Fondaclee</em> near <em>Tophana</em>.</p>

<p>In <em>Constantinople</em> there are several narrow
streets of Trade, closed up with sheds and
pent-houses, which I suppose were in use before
the <em>Greeks</em> lost their Empire, and are the
same with the σκεπαστοὶ καὶ φρακτοὶ δρόμοι in <em>Chrysaloras</em>
his<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>Epistle. But besides
these places, several Trades have
their distant quarters. The
streets are raised for the most part on each
side for the greater convenience.</p>

<p>Not far from <em>Suleimania</em> is the house of the
<em>Aga</em> or General of the <em>Janizaries</em>, which so
often changes its Masters.</p>

<p><em>Pompey</em>'s pillar, as the <em>Franks</em> erroneously call
it, is of the <em>Corinthian</em> order, curiously wrought,
about eighteen foot in height and three in
Diameter.</p>

<p><em>Beshiktash</em>, a Village within three or four
miles of <em>Constantinople</em> towards the <em>Bosphorus</em>,
where lies buried the famous Pirate <em>Ariadin</em>,
whom the <em>Christian</em> Writers call <em>Barbarossa</em>,
who built here a handsome Mosch, having
two rows of Pillars at the entrance. The
Captain <em>Bassa</em> usually, before he puts to Sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
with his Armata of Gallies, visits the Tomb
of this fortunate Robber, who had made several
thousand <em>Christians</em> Slaves, and makes his
Prayers at the neighbouring Church for the
good Success of his expedition.</p>

<p>They reckon in the City above a hundred
publick Baths, every street almost affording
one. They are esteemed works of great Piety
and Charity; there being a continual use of
them, not only upon the accompt of Religion,
but of Health and Cleanliness. For their Diet
being for the most part hot spiced meats in
the Winter, and crude fruits in the Summer,
their Liquor Fountain Water, or Coffee, to
which we may add their lazy kind of Life
(for walking is never used by them for digestion,
or otherwise in the way of diversion) frequent
bathing becomes necessary.</p>

<p>There are several receptacles of Water under
Ground, and one particularly under the
Church of <em>Sancta Sophia</em>, as I was informed;
but I did not think it worth my curiosity to
descend into it. These were of great use to
the poor <em>Greeks</em> in the last fatal Siege; but the
<em>Turks</em> are so secure, that they do not think,
that they deserve either cost or pains to keep
the Waters sweet, or the cisterns in repair.</p>

<p>The <em>Aqueducts</em>, which answer to those glorious
<em>Aqueducts</em>, near <em>Pyrgos</em>, and convey the
water to the great cistern near Sultan <em>Selim</em>'s
Mosch, are in that part of <em>Constantinople</em>,
which lies between the Mosch of <em>Mahomet</em> the
Great and <em>Shaxade</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Turks</em> began to besiege <em>Constantinople</em>
on the fifth of <em>April</em>, and took it the twenty
ninth of <em>May</em> on <em>Whitsun Tuesday</em> morning 1453.
or as the <em>Turks</em> reckon in the year 857. of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
<em>Hegira</em>, or flight of <em>Mahomet</em>, the 22 day of
the first <em>Jomad</em>.</p>

<p>The Chappel, where <em>Ejub Sultan</em> is interred,
at whose Head and Feet I observed great wax
Candles, is enclosed with latten wire Grates,
for the better accommodation of such religious
<em>Turks</em> as come to pay their respect to the memory
of this great <em>Musulman</em> Saint. In the
middle of the Area there is raised a building
sustained by excellent marble Pillars, ascended
by two several pair of stairs, where the
new Emperor is inaugurated, and where he
usually goes in <em>Biram</em>-time.</p>

<h2><em>An account of the City of <strong>Prusa</strong> in
<strong>Bythynia</strong>, and a continuation of
the Historical Observations relating
to <strong>Constantinople</strong>, by the
Reverend and learned <strong>Thomas
Smith</strong> D. D. fellow of <strong>Magd.
Coll. Oxon.</strong> and of the <strong>Royal
Society</strong>.</em></h2>


<p><em>Montanea</em> formerly called <em>Nicopolis</em> according
to <em>Bellonius</em>, or rather <em>Cios</em>, the
bay hence called <em>Sinus Cianus</em>, lies in the bottom
of a Bay about Fourscore miles from <em>Constantinople</em>,
and is the Scale or Landing-place
for <em>Prusa</em>, from which it may be about twelve
miles; in the middle way to which is the
Village <em>Moussanpoula</em>.</p>

<p><em>Prusa</em>, now called by the <em>Turks</em> <em>Bursia</em>, the
chief City of <em>Bythynia</em>, is seated at the foot
partly, and partly upon the rising of the mount
<em>Olympus</em>, which is one of the highest Hills of
the lesser <em>Asia</em>. Its top is covered with Snow
for nine or ten Months of the Year, several
streams of Water flowing down the Hill continually,
accounted very unwholesom from
the Snow mixed with it. In the upper part
of the City to the North-west lies the Seraglio,
which is walled round; but the Emperors not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
residing here since their acquests in <em>Thrace</em>,
or scarce making visits to this Imperial City,
and none of their Sons living here of late,
according to the former Policy of the <em>Turkish</em>
Emperors, who did not permit their Sons,
when grown up, to be near them, but sent
them to some Honourable Employment, accompanied
with a Bassa and Cadi to instruct
them in the Arts of War and Government,
it lies now neglected and despoiled of all its
ornaments.</p>

<p>In this part also are the Sepulchers of <em>Osman</em>,
the founder of the Family, which now
Reigns, and his Son <em>Urchan</em>, who took the
City, near a Mosch, formerly a <em>Christian</em>
Church dedicated to St. <em>John</em>, and where was
formerly a Convent of Religious, built by
<em>Constantinus Iconomachus</em>, where I saw the figure
of a Cross still remaining upon the Wall.
Here hangs up a Drum of a vast bigness,
such as they carry upon the backs of Cammels,
and I suppose is one of those which they used
in the taking the Place.</p>

<p>In the lower part, near the bottom of the
Hill, <em>Morad</em> the second, the Father of <em>Mahomet</em>
the Great, lies buried: near whereunto
was formerly the Metropolitical Church of
the <em>Holy Apostles</em>. The <em>Bezesten</em>, or Exchange,
seems to be much better and larger than the
great one at <em>Constantinople</em>, as are the several
Caravanserais built for the use and accommodation
of Merchants, and Travellers; in one of
which, the Rice Chane, I took up my quarters.</p>

<p>Without the City toward the East is the
Mosch and Sepulcher of the Emperor <em>Bajazid</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the first, whom the <em>Turks</em> call <em>Jilderim</em> or lightning,
and the Greek Writers λαίλαψ. Not
far from hence is the Mosch of <em>Mahomet</em>
the first, and his Sepulcher. Toward the
West upon the side of the Hill is the Mosch
of <em>Morad</em> the First, whom they call <em>Gazi</em> or
the Conqueror, near which he lies buried.
There are in the whole about 124 Moschs,
several of which were formerly <em>Christian</em>
Churches, and between fifty and sixty Chanes.
The Castles built by <em>Osman</em>, when he besieged
the City, are slighted and altogether unfortified,
the one to the North, the other to the
South-West.</p>

<p>At <em>Checkerghe</em>, about a mile and a half out
of Town, are the hot Baths, much frequented
both by <em>Christians</em> and <em>Turks</em>. They are made
very Convenient to Bath in, and are covered
over, that they may be used in all Weathers.
Among others, there is a large round <em>Basin</em>,
where they usually divert themselves by Swimming.</p>

<p>What opinions the <em>Turks</em> have of our Blessed
<em>Saviour</em> and the <em>Christian</em> Religion, I shall
briefly shew, as they lie dispersed in several
Chapters of the <em>Alcoran</em>, according to which
they frame their Discourse, whensoever either
Zeal or Curiosity puts them upon this Topick.
For <em>Mahomet</em> upon his setting up to be the
Author of a new Religion, finding such a considerable
part of the World professing the
doctrine of <em>Christ</em>, with all the Mysteries of
Faith therein contained, was cast upon a necessity
of saying something both concerning
Him and It. By which it will appear, how
great the Power of Truth is above Imposture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
and Subtility, and that as the Devils in the
Possessed confess'd, though against their Wills,
<em>Christ</em> to be the Son of <em>God</em>, so this <em>Dæmoniack</em>
in the midst of all his Forgeries and Lies,
and Ridiculous and Childish Narratives, not
being able to contradict the universal Belief
of the <em>Christians</em> of that, and the preceding
Ages, founded on the History of the Gospel,
hath been forced to give Testimony to
several particulars of it.</p>

<p>They confess then that <em>Christ</em> was Born of
a Pure Spotless Virgin, the Virgin <em>Mary</em>,
chosen by <em>God</em> and sanctified above all the
Women in the World; and that the Angel
<em>Gabriel</em> was dispatched out of Heaven to acquaint
her with the News of it. That such
a kind of Miraculous and Supernatural Birth
never hapned to any besides, and that <em>Christ</em>
was conceived by the <em>Holy Ghost</em>, and that
he wrought mighty Miracles, for Instance,
that he cleansed Lepers, gave Sight to the
Blind, restored Sick Persons to their Health,
and raised the Dead.</p>

<p>That he is a great Prophet, sent by <em>God</em>
to convert Men from the Vanity and Error
of their false Worship to the Knowledge of
the true <em>God</em>, to Preach Righteousness, and to
correct and restore the Imperfection and Miscarriages
of Humane Nature; that he was of
a most Holy and Exemplary Life, that he
was the true Word of <em>God</em>, the <em>Apostle</em> or
<em>Ambassador</em> of <em>God</em>; That his Gospel was revealed
to him from Heaven, and that he is
in Heaven standing nigh to the Throne of
<em>God</em>. They Blaspheme indeed with a Brutishness
and Stupidity only befitting <em>Turks</em>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Mysteries of the <em>Holy Trinity</em>, and of the Divinity
of our <em>Blessed Saviour</em>, and deny that
he was put to Death, and say that another
in his Shape was Crucified by the <em>Jews</em>, and
that he himself was assumed into Heaven in
his Body without dying at all, and consequently
they will not own, that he satisfied Divine
Justice for the Sins of the World; so
great an affinity is there between the Heresie
of <em>Socinus</em> and profess'd <em>Mahometanism</em>.</p>

<p>I could never yet see any <em>Turkish</em> Translation
of the <em>Alcoran</em>; they cry up the Elegance
of the Style, which being Enthusiastick
and High-flown, by reason also of the tinkling
of the Periods, is very delightful to their
Ears, who seem to be affected with Rhime
mightily. Though I suppose it is upon a more
Politick Account, that they are so averse, as to
the translating it into their vulgar Language,
not out of respect to the Sacredness of the
Original only, whose full commanding Expressions
they think cannot be translated
without a great diminution to the Sense; but
to keep it in greater Veneration among the
People, who might be apt to Slight and Dis-esteem
it, should it become thus common among
them. It is enough, that the Priests
and Learned Men explain the difficult Passages
of it to the People, and write Commentaries
for the use of the more Curious
and Inquisitive. The <em>Persians</em> on the contrary
think it no disparagement to the <em>Arabick</em>,
or Profanation of the Sense, to Translate
this cursed Book into their own Language,
and Copies are frequent among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>Grand Signior</em>'s Women are usually the
choicest Beauties of the Christian Spoils, presented
by the <em>Bassa's</em> or <em>Tartars</em>. The present
<em>Sultana</em>, the Mother of the young Prince
<em>Mustapha</em>, is a Candiot; the <em>Valide</em> or Emperor's
Mother, a <em>Russian</em>, the Daughter of
a poor Priest, who with her Relations were
seized upon by the <em>Tartars</em> in an Incursion,
which they made into the <em>Muscovites</em> Country.
She being receiv'd into the <em>Seraglio</em>, by
her beautiful Complexion and cunning Behaviour,
gain'd the Heart and Affection of
<em>Sultan Ibrahim</em> (a Man wholly addicted to
soft Pleasures, and who seldom cared to be long
absent from the Women's Apartment, but chose
to spend his time among them) having the
good fortune to be the Mother of the Prince
<em>Mahomet</em>, the eldest Son of his Father, who
now Reigns, she had all the Honours that
could possibly be done her, and was the beloved
<em>Hazaki</em> or chief Concubine. During
this height of Splendor and Glory, the Court
removing from <em>Constantinople</em> to <em>Adrianople</em>,
distant about an Hundred and Twenty Miles,
as she was passing in great State attended
with her Guards, through the Streets of the
City, in a Coach, much like our Carriage-Wagons,
but that they are latticed to let in
the Air (for no one must presume to stare
or scarce look upon the Women, much less
must they themselves suffer their Faces to be
seen in this jealous Country) she out of Curiosity
looking through the holes, saw a poor
<em>Christian</em> Slave in a Shop, where Sugar and
such like Wares were Sold. Upon her return
she sent one of her Eunuchs to enquire for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the Person, and to ask him several Questions
about his Country, Relations, Friends,
and the time when and how long he had been
a Slave: His answers were so particular and
satisfactory, that she was soon convinc'd of
the Truth and Certainty of her apprehensions,
when she first cast her Eyes upon him, that
he was her Brother, and accordingly it proved
so. Whereupon acquainting the Emperor
with it, she immediately redeemed him
from his Patron, and having made the poor
Wretch turn <em>Turk</em>, got him considerably preferred.</p>

<p>The Bassa's for the most part are the Sons
of <em>Christians</em>, taken into the <em>Seraglio</em>, near
the Emperor's Person, and so are prefer'd to
considerable Governments, or else they raise
themselves by their Conduct and Valour. <em>Mahomet</em>
Bassa in the time of <em>Achmet</em>, whose
eldest Daughter he Married, was the first
natural <em>Turk</em>, that was made chief Vizir, having
before been Captain Bassa. The chief
Vizir <em>Mahomet Kupriuli</em>, (who settled the
Empire in the Minority of this Emperor,
when it was ready to be shaken into Pieces,
and dissolved by several powerful Factions
in the State, and by the Mutinies and Discontents
of the <em>Janizaries</em> and <em>Saphi's</em>, who
drove different ways) was an <em>Albaneze</em> by
Birth, the Son of a <em>Greek</em> Priest, whom out
of the height of Zeal for <em>Mahomet</em>, he made
turn <em>Turk</em> in his Old Age, and converted the
<em>Christian</em> Church in the Village where he was
Born into a Mosch. This Man also forbad
the <em>Dervises</em> to Dance in a Ring and turn
round, which before was their solemn Pra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>ctice
at set times before the People, which
they would do so long, till they were giddy
by this swift circular Motion, and fell down
in a Swound, and then oftentimes upon their
recovery from such Trances, they pretended
to Revelation. The Church-Men are not
very kind to his Memory, looking upon him
as a Man of little or no Religion; and they
give out, that if he had lived, he would
have forbid their calling to Prayers from the
Spires of their Moschs, and hanging out
Lamps; both which they look upon as Solemn
and Essential to the exercise of Religion;
but he as the effect of Bigotry and
Superstition.</p>

<p>They have a mighty Honour and Esteem
for Physicians, for though they are of Opinion,
that they cannot with all their Art
prolong Life, the Period and Term of it being
Fatal, and absolutely determin'd by God,
yet they often consult them upon any violent
Sickness or Pain, in order to make the
time allotted them in this World more pleasant
and easie. It is extraordinary rare,
that a natural <em>Turk</em> makes Physick his Profession
and Study. They who practice it among
them, when I was in <em>Turky</em>, were for
the most part <em>Greeks</em> and <em>Jews</em>, who know nothing
of Chymical Medicines, but follow the
usual Methods, which they learnt in <em>Italy</em>
and <em>Spain</em>, the former having studied in <em>Padua</em>,
and the latter in <em>Salamanca</em>, where they
pass for good <em>Catholicks</em>. And I remember I
met with a certain <em>Jew</em> Physician, who had
been a Capuchine in <em>Portugal</em>. During the tedious
Siege of <em>Candia</em>, the <em>Vizir</em>, what with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
melancholy, and what with the ill Air of the
Camp, finding himself much indispos'd, sent
for a <em>Christian</em> Physician <em>Signior Massalins</em>, a
subject of the Republick of <em>Venice</em>, but Married
to a <em>Greek</em> Woman, by whom he had several
Children, who was our Neighbour at
<em>Pera</em>, an experienc'd able Man, to come speedily
to him, and made him a Present of about a
thousand Dollars, in order to fit himself for
the Voyage and bear the expence of it. By
this worthy Gentleman's Care, he recovered
his Health, and would not permit him to depart,
till after the surrendry of that City,
which might be about seven Months after his
Arrival there, treating him in the mean
while with all imaginable Respect. During
our short stay at <em>Bursia</em>, one of our <em>Janizaries</em>
accidentally discoursing with a <em>Turk</em> about us,
whom they knew to be <em>Franks</em>, told him that
there was a Physician in the Company, who
had been lately at the Grand <em>Signior</em>'s Court
at <em>Saloniki</em> with the <em>English</em> Ambassador, and
was now upon his return from <em>Constantinople</em>
to <em>Smyrna</em>, where he lived. This presently
took vent, and the <em>Turks</em> thought that they
had got a Man among them, that could Cure
all Diseases Infallibly; for several immediately
came to find us out in behalf of themselves
or their Sick Friends, and one of the
most considerable Men upon the Place, desir'd
the Doctor to go to his House to visit
one of his Women Sick in Bed, who being
permitted to feel her naked Pulse (for usually
they throw a piece of fine Silk or Curl
over their Womens Wrists at such times) soon
discovered by that and other Symptoms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Indications of her Distemper, that opening a
Vein would presently give her Ease and recover
her: which he did accordingly; for
which he received an embroidered Handkerchief
instead of a Fee, and gained the Reputation
of having done a mighty Cure.</p>

<p>They have little of Ingenious or Solid
Learning among them; their chief Study,
next to the <em>Alcoran</em>, being metaphysical Niceties
about the Attributes of <em>God</em>, or else the
Maintenance of other odd speculative Notions
and Tenets, derived down to them
from some of their famed Masters and Holy
Men, whom they pretend to follow. Their
Knowledge of the motion of the Heavens,
for which the <em>Arabians</em> and the other Eastern
Nations have been so deservedly famous,
as their Astronomical Tables of the Longitude
and Latitude of the fixed Stars, and
of the appulse of the Moon to them, fully
evince, is now very mean, and is chiefly studied
for the use of Judiciary Astrology. The
great Instrument they make use of is an
Astrolabe, with which they make very imperfect
Observations, having no such thing
as a Quadrant or Sextant, much less a Telescope,
or any mechanical Engine, to direct
and assist them in their Calculation. Their
Skill in <em>Geography</em> is as inconsiderable; I remember
I heard the Captain Bassa, whom
they stile Admiral of the Black and White
Seas, meaning the <em>Euxine</em> and the <em>Mediterranean</em>,
ask this silly Question; whether <em>England</em>
were out of the Streights? and at another
time the <em>Caymican</em> or Governour of <em>Constantinople</em>,
hearing that <em>England</em> was an Island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
desired to know, how many Miles it was about,
in order, we supposed, to make an estimate
of our King's Greatness and Strength
by the extent and compass of it.</p>

<p>One of the great Astrologers of <em>Constantinople</em>,
having heard that I had a pair of Globes
in my Chamber, made me a Visit on purpose
to see their contrivance, being introduced
by a worthy Gentleman of our own Nation.
After the first Ceremonies were over, I took
my Terrestrial Globe, and rectified it to the
position of the Place, and pointed to the several
Circles both without and upon it, and
told him in short the several uses of them:
Then shewed him how <em>Constantinople</em> bared
from <em>Candia</em> at that time Besieged, <em>Cair</em>, <em>Aleppo</em>,
<em>Mecca</em>, and other chief Places of the Empire,
with the other Parts of the World: At
which he was mightily surprized to see the
whole Earth and Sea represented in that Figure
and in so narrow a compass, and pleased
himself with turning the Globe round several
times together. Afterwards I set before him
the Celestial Globe, and rectified that, and
shewed him how all the noted Constellations
were exactly described, and how they moved
regularly upon their Poles, as in the Heavens;
some rising, and others setting, some
always above the Horison, and others always
under, in an oblique Sphere, and particularly
what Stars would rise that Night with
us at such an Hour; the Man seemed to be
ravished with the Curiosity of it, turning this
Globe also several times together with his
Finger, and taking a mighty Pleasure in viewing
the motion of it: and yet this silly Animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
past for a Conjurer among the <em>Turks</em>, and
was look'd upon as one that could foretel
the events of Battels, the fates of Empires,
and the end of the World.</p>

<p>They have no Genius for Sea-Voyages,
and consequently are very Raw and Unexperienc'd
in the Art of Navigation, scarce venturing
to Sail out of Sight of Land. I speak
of the natural <em>Turks</em>, who Trade either into
the <em>Black Sea</em>, or some part of the <em>Morea</em>,
or between <em>Constantinople</em> and <em>Alexandria</em>; and
not of the Pyrats of <em>Barbary</em>, who are for the
most part Renegado's, and learn'd their Skill
in Christendom, which they exercise so much
to the Terror and Damage of it. A <em>Turkish</em>
Compass consists but of eight Points, the
four Cardinal and four Collateral; they being
at a mighty Loss how to Sail by a side
Wind, when by hauling their Sails sharp, they
might lie their Course, and much more, when
they are in the Winds Eye, not knowing how to
make Tacks and Bords, but choose rather to
make hast into some Neighbouring Port, 'till the
Wind blows fair. An <em>English</em> and <em>Turkish</em> Vessel
both bound for the Bay of <em>Saloniki</em>, at the
time of the Grand Signior's being there, past
together out of the <em>Hellespont</em>; but foul Weather
happening, the <em>Turks</em> got into <em>Lemnos</em>;
while our Men kept at Sea and pursued their
Voyage, and after three Weeks stay, returned
back to us, observing in their way,
that the <em>Turks</em> remained in the same place
where they left them, for want of a Fore-Wind
to put to Sea in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>They trouble not themselves with reading
the Histories of other Nations or of antient
times, much less with the Study of
<em>Chronology</em>, without which, History is very
lame and imperfect; which is the cause of
those ridiculous and childish Mistakes, which
pass current and uncontradicted among them.
For instance, they make <em>Job</em> one of <em>Solomon</em>'s
Judges and (<em>Iscander</em>) <em>Alexander</em> the great
Captain General of his Army. They number
<em>Philip</em> of <em>Macedon</em> among the Ancestors
of our <em>Blessed Saviour</em>, and believe that <em>Sampson</em>,
<em>Jonas</em>, and St. <em>George</em> were his Contemporaries.
In this they are more excusable then
their false Prophet <em>Mahomet</em>, who in his <em>Alcoran</em>
has perverted several Historical Notices
in the Writings of the Old Testament,
and is guilty of vile and absurd Pseudo-chronismes.
To remedy this defect, of which he
was very conscious, and the better to understand
the States of <em>Christendom</em>, and the particular
Kingdoms and Republicks of it, the
late Great and Wise <em>Vizir</em>, <em>Achmet</em>, made his
Interpreter <em>Panagiotti</em>, a Learned <em>Greek</em>, at
leisure Hours, even at the Siege of <em>Candia</em>,
as well as at other times, read several ancient
Histories to him, and render them <em>Ex-tempore</em>
into the <em>Turkish</em> Language, and particularly
<em>Blaeus Atlas</em>, with which he was mightily
pleased, and made great use of, and
truly gained the Reputation of a solid and
judicious States-man, as well as Souldier among
the <em>Christian</em> Ministers, who in the ordinary
course of their Negotiations apply'd
themselves to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Tho' their Year be according to the course
of the Moon, and so the <em>Turkish</em> Months run
round the civil Year in a Circle of thirty
three Years and a few odd Days, yet they
celebrate the <em>Neuruz</em>, which signifies in the
<em>Persian</em> Tongue the New Year, the twenty
first Day of <em>March</em> (on which Day the vernal
Equinox was fixed by the <em>Greeks</em> and other Oriental
<em>Christians</em>, in the time of the Emperor <em>Constantine</em>,
who made no Provision for the προήγεσις
ἰσημερινὴ, or Precession, which in process
of Time the inequality between the Civil and
Astronomical Year must necessarily produce)
at which time the <em>Cadyes</em> and other annual
Magistrates, and Farmers of the Customs
take Place, and reckon to that Day twelve
Month again.</p>

<p>In their civil Deportment and Behaviour
one towards another, the left Hand is the
more Worthy and Honourable Place, except
among their Ecclesiasticks; and the Reason
they alledge is, because they Write from the
right Hand, and the Sword is worn on the
left Side, and so is more at his disposal, who
walks on that Hand. The chief <em>Vizir</em> accordingly
in the <em>Divan</em> sits at the left Hand
of the <em>Mufty</em>, each maintaining their Right
of Precedence according to this way of decision.</p>

<p>In their Moschs they sit without any distinction
of degrees.</p>

<p>Some of the more zealous <em>Turks</em> cause to
be engraven on their Scymitars and Bucklers
a Sentence out of the sixty first <em>Surat</em>, which
is concerning Fighting or Battle-array, and
contains Incouragements to Fight in the <em>Way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
and Paths of God</em>, as the Impostor Words it;
for which he assures them, besides assistance
from Heaven to help them to get the Victory
over their Enemies, and that <em>God will Pardon
their Sins and bring them to Paradice</em>. Thus
spirited with Zeal, a <em>Turk</em> lays about him with
Fury, when he is a fighting, and seems ambitious
of dying to gain the delights of Paradice,
at least indifferent whether he dies or
lives.</p>

<p>The <em>Turks</em> are as to their Temper serious,
or rather inclining to morosity, seldom Laughing,
which is accounted an argument of great
Vanity and Lightness. They perform the
Exercises, which they use in the way of Diversion,
as Shooting and Hunting, with a
great deal of gravity, as if they designed
them more for Health than for Pleasure; and
this too but seldom. The better and richer
sort, who have nothing to do, sitting all Day
at Home, lolling upon a Sofa or rais'd Place
in their Rooms, and taking Tobacco, which
their Slaves fill and light for them: And if
they retire in the Summer or Autumn, for a
Week or Fort-night to some convenient
Fountain in a Wood with their Women, it
is chiefly to enjoy the Refreshments of the
cool Air. In the times of Triumph indeed
for some great Success obtained against the
<em>Christians</em>, when the Shops are open for three
Nights together, and hung with Lights, as
well as the Spires of the Moschs in curious
Figures, they are guilty of extravagant
Mirth, running up and down the Streets in
Companies, and sometimes Singing and Dancing
after their rude way; but this fit being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
over, they soon return to their former Melancholy.
In the Coffee-Houses where they
use to resort to Tipple, there is usually one
hired by the Owners to read either an idle
Book of Tales, which they admire as Wit,
or filthy obscene Stories, with which they
seem wonderfully affected and pleased, few
of them being able to Read. These are the
Schools, which they frequent for their Information,
tho' in times of War, when things
went ill with them, their Discourses would
be of the ill Government; and the Grand
Signior himself and his chief Ministers could
not escape their Censures, which manifestly
tending to Sedition, and to the heightning
of their Discontents by their mutual Complaints,
and by this free venting of their
Grievances during the War at <em>Candia</em>, the
Wise Vizir seeing the evil Consequences that
would follow, if such Meetings and Discourses
were any longer tolerated, Commanded,
that all the publick Coffee-houses should be
shut up in <em>Constantinople</em> and several other great
Cities of the Empire, where the Malcontents
used to rendezvouz themselves, and
find fault upon every ill Success and Miscarriage
with the administration of Affairs.</p>

<p>The custom of the <em>Turks</em> to salute the Emperor
or the <em>Vizir Bassa</em>'s with loud Acclamations
and Wishes of Health and long Life,
when they appear first in their Houses or any
publick Place, is derived from the <em>Greeks</em>, who
took it from the <em>Romans</em>. This was done by
them in a kind of Singing Tone; whence
<em>Luitprandus</em> Bishop of <em>Cremona</em> tells us, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
in a certain Procession (προέλυσις) at which he
was present, they Sang to the Emperor <em>Nicephorus</em>
πολλὰ ἔτη that is, many Years, (which
<em>Codinus</em>, who lived just about the taking of
<em>Constantinople</em>, by the <em>Turks</em>, expresses τὸ ψάλλειν
τὸ πολυχρόνιον or by τὸ πολυχρονίζειν and the
wish or salute by πολυχρόνισμα) and at Dinner
the <em>Greeks</em> then present wish'd with a loud
Voice to the Emperor and <em>Bardas</em>, <em>Ut Deus
annos multiplicet</em>, as he Translates the <em>Greek</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Turkish</em> Coin in it self is pitiful and inconsiderable,
which I ascribe not only to their
want of Bullion, but to their little Skill in
matters relating to the Mint. Hence it comes to
pass that Zecchines and Hungars for Gold, and
<em>Spanish</em> Dollars and Zalotts for Silver stampt
in <em>Christendom</em> pass current among them, most
of the great Payments being made in them,
they not caring either through Ignorance or
Sloth to follow the Example of the <em>Indian</em> or
<em>Persian</em> Emperors, who usually melt down the
<em>Christian</em> Mony imported by the Merchants
into their several Countries, and give it a
new Stamp. The most usual pieces are the
Sheriphi of Gold, somewhat less in value
than a <em>Venetian</em> Zecchine, and Aspers; ten of
which are equal to six Pence <em>English</em>, and some
few three Asper Pieces. A Mangur is an ugly
old Copper Piece, eight of which make
but one Asper, and is not I think a <em>Turkish</em>
Coin, but rather <em>Greek</em>. They have no Arms
upon their Coin, only Letters embossed on
both sides, containing the Emperor's Name,
or some short Sentence out of the <em>Alcoran</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Turks</em> look upon Earthquakes as Ominous,
as the vulgar do upon Eclipses, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
understanding the Philosophy of them. During
my stay in <em>Constantinople</em>, which was above
2 Years, there hapned but one, which was
<em>October 26. 1669.</em> about six a Clock in the
Morning a stark Calm preceeding. It lasted
very near a Minute, and we at <em>Pera</em> and
<em>Galata</em> were as sensible of it, as those who
were on the other side of the Water; but
praised be God nothing fell, and we were
soon rid of the Fears in which this frightful
Accident had cast us, being in our Beds, and
not able by reason of the Surprize in so little
a space to have past through a Gallery down
a pair of Stairs into the Court, if we had attempted
it. The <em>Turks</em> made direful Reflexions
on it, as if some Calamity would inevitably
fall upon the Empire, quickly forgetting
the great Triumphings and Rejoycings
which they exprest but a few Days before for
the Surrendry of <em>Candia</em>. In the Year 1668.
in <em>August</em>, the Earth shook more or less for
forty-seven Days together in the lesser <em>Asia</em>
at <em>Anguri</em> (<em>Ancyra</em>), and for fifteen at <em>Bacbasar</em>,
as we heard from a <em>Scotch</em> Merchant,
who liv'd there: And particularly, that at
this latter Place on the second of <em>August</em>, between
three and four of the Clock in the Afternoon
it lasted for a quarter of an Hour;
several Houses were overthrown, and some
hundreds of Chimneys fell (it being a very
populous Town) and yet there were but seven
kill'd. The trembling being so violent,
both <em>Turks</em> and <em>Christians</em> forsook their Houses,
and betook themselves to the Fields,
Vineyards, and Gardens, where they made
their Abode for several Days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Their Punishments are very severe, this
being judg'd the most effectual way to prevent
all publick Disorders and Mischiefs.
They use no great Formality in their
Processes: If the Criminal be taken in the
Fact, and the Witnesses ready and present
to attest it, and sometimes if there be but
probable circumstances, without full Conviction,
condemn him; and soon after Sentence,
sometimes an Hour, or less, hurry him away
to Execution. For an ordinary Crime, hanging
is the usual Death: But for Robbery and
Murder, committed upon the High Way by
such as Rob in Parties and alarm whole Provinces,
or for Sacriledge, or for any hainous
Crime against the Government, either
Gaunching or Excoriation, or cutting off the
Legs and Arms, and leaving the Trunk of
the Body in the High Way, or Empaling,
that is, thrusting an Iron Stake through the
Body out under the Neck or at the Mouth;
in which extreme Torment the miserable
Wretch may live two or three Days, if the
Guts or the Heart happen not to be wounded
by the pointed Spike in its Passage. This
Punishment seems to have been in use among
the <em>Romans</em>, <em>Seneca</em>'s Epist. 14. <em>Cogita hoc loco
carcerem, &amp; cruces, &amp; eculeos, &amp; uncum, &amp;
adactum per medium hominem, qui per os emergat,
stipitem</em>: and so in his Book <em>De Consolatione
ad Marciam cap.</em> 20. <em>Ali capite conversos in terram
suspendere: Alii per obscena stipitem egerunt:
Alii brachia patibulo explicuerunt.</em> Murder is
seldom Pardon'd, and especially if the Relations
of the Murder'd Person demand Justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>The Circumcision, tho' it be a Sacred
Right, is perform'd in their private Houses,
and never in the Moschs.</p>

<p>The Women colour their Eye-Brows and
Lids with an ugly black Powder, I suppose,
to set off their Beauty by such a Shadow;
and their Nails with the Powder of <em>Kanna</em>,
which gives them a Tincture of faint Red,
like Brick (as they do the Tails and Hoofs
of Horses) which they look upon as a great
Ornament. Their great diversion is Bathing;
sometimes thrice, if not four times a Week.
They do not permit them to go to Church in
time of Prayer, for fear they should spoil
their Devotion: The <em>Turks</em> being of so brutish
a Temper, that their Lust is rais'd upon
the sight of a fair Object. They are call'd
oftentimes by the Names of Flowers and
Fruits, and sometimes Phantastick Names are
given them, such as <em>Sucar Birpara</em>, or bit of
Sugar, <em>Dil Ferib</em>, or Ravisher of Hearts, and
the like.</p>

<p>Their Skill in Agriculture is very mean.
In their Gardens they have several little
Trenches to convey Water, where it may be
most necessary for their Plants and Flowers.
They know little or nothing of manuring
their Grounds: Sometimes they burn their
Fields and Vineyards after Harvest and Vintage,
partly to destroy the Vermin, and partly
to enrich the Soil. They tread out their
Corn with Oxen, drawing a square Plank
Board, about a Foot and a half or two Foot
over, studded with Flints, and winnow it
upon their threshing Floors in the open Air,
the Wind blowing away the Chaff. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
feed their Horses with Barly and chopt
Straw; for I do not remember ever to have
seen any Oats among them; and they make
but little Hay.</p>

<p>For Draught of great Weight in their
Carts they make use of Buffalo's.</p>

<p>Camels will endure Travel four Days together
without Water, and will eat tops of
Thistles, Shrubs, or any kind of Boughs:
They are very sure-footed, and kneel when
they are a loading, and live to a considerable
number of Years, some even to sixty.</p>

<p>The chief Furniture of their Houses are Carpets
or Mats of <em>Grand Cairo</em>, neatly wrought
with Straw, spread upon the Ground; they
having no occasion of Chairs, Couches, Stools,
or Tables; their postures within Doors, being
different from ours. They have no
Hangings, but their Walls are whited and
set off with Painting, only adorn'd with a
kind of Porcelane; no Beds clos'd with
Curtains.</p>

<p>They seal not with Wax, but Ink, at the bottom
of the Paper the Emperor's Name being usually
written with Flourishes and in perplext
Characters: Nor have they any Coats of Arms
upon their Seals, there being no such thing as
Gentility among them.</p>

<p>Some of them, notwithstanding their Zeal
for <em>Mahomet</em> and the Religion by him establish'd,
retain not only a favourable and honourable
Opinion of our Blessed <em>Saviour</em>, but
even place some kind of Confidence in the
usage of his Name, or of the Words of the
Gospel, tho' it may seem to be wholly in the
way of Superstition. Thus in their Amu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>lets,
which they call <em>Chaimaili</em>, being little
bits of Paper of two or three Fingers breadth,
roul'd up in pieces of Silk, containing several
short Prayers or Sentences out of the <em>Alcoran</em>,
with several Circles with other Figures,
they usually inscribe the Holy and Venerable
Name of <em>JESUS</em>, or the Figure of the
Cross, or the first Words of St. <em>John</em>'s Gospel,
and the like; they hang them about their
Necks, or place them under their Arm-pits, or
in their Bosom near their Hearts (being the
same with what the <em>Greeks</em> call ἐγκόλπια) and
especially when they go to War, as a preservative
against the Dangers of it; and indeed against
any misfortune whatsoever. Some have
them sow'd within their Caps: And I heard
of a <em>Turk</em>, who was so superstitious herein,
that he always pluck'd it off, and was uncover'd
when he had occasion to make Water.
Some are such Bigots in their Religion, and
so furious against the Christians, that not
only do they treat them with all imaginable
Scorn and Contempt, but take it ill to be salam'd
or saluted by them, as if it were the
effect of Sawciness or unbecoming Familiarity.
Their Malice against the Christians
makes them envy the rich Furs they line
their Vests with, and it is a trouble to these
hypocritical Zealots to see the <em>Franks</em> ride upon
their fine <em>Arabian</em> Horses.</p>

<p>The respect which they shew the <em>Alcoran</em> is
wonderful: They dare not open the Leaves
of it with unwashen Hands, according to the
Advice or Command written in <em>Arabick</em> upon
the Cover, <em>Let no one touch this Book, but
he that is clean</em>. They kiss it, and bend their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Heads and touch their Eyes with it, both
when they open it and shut it.</p>

<p>The <em>Janizaries</em>, when they attend upon
<em>Christian Ambassadors</em> to their Audience, seem
to appear in their Bravery, and in a Habit
far from that of a Soldier, being without
either Fire-Arms or Swords, (which latter
are not worn but in time of Service), or when
they are upon a March, or embodied, wearing
a Cap made of Camel's Hair, with a
broad Flap dangling behind, a gilt embroider'd
Wreath running round it, and an
oblong piece of Brass rising up from the
middle of their Forehead near a Foot, with
a great Club in their Hand, like inferior Officers
of the Civil Government. But when they
are in the Camp, they throw off their upper
Vest, and Turbants, which they wear at all
other usual times, as troublesome, and put
on a <em>Fess</em>, or red Cap, which sits close to
their Head, and tuck up their <em>Duliman</em> or
long Coat, to their Girdle, that they may
be the more quick and expedite in their
Charge.</p>

<p>They affect finery and neatness in their
Cloths and Shashes; not so much as a spot
to be seen upon them, and in rainy or suspicious
Weather, are very careful how they go
abroad without their <em>Yamurlicks</em>, which is a
kind of Coat they throw over their Heads at
such times.</p>

<p>Their Pans and Dishes are for the most
part of Copper, but so handsomly Tinn'd over,
that they look like Silver.</p>

<p>There are thousands of Gypsies or <em>Zinganies</em>
in <em>Turky</em>, who live the same idle nasty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
kind of Life, as they do in <em>Christendom</em>, and
pretend to the same Art of telling Fortunes;
and are look'd upon as the Off-scouring of
Mankind. It is accounted the extremest
point of human Misery to be a Slave to any
of this sort of Cattel.</p>

<p>The <em>Haggi</em>, or Pilgrims, that have been at
<em>Mecca</em> and <em>Medina</em>, forbear to drink Wine
most Religiously, out of a perswasion, that
one drop would efface all the Merits of that
troublesome and expensive Journey; and some
have been possess'd with such a mad Zeal,
that they have blinded themselves after their
having been bless'd with the sight of <em>Mahomet</em>'s
Sepulcher.</p>

<p>After <em>Jatzih</em>, that is, an Hour and a half
in the Night, throughout the whole Year,
there is as great a silence in the Streets as at
Midnight: The Emperor <em>Achmet</em> in the Year
1611. having made an Order, that no one
should presume to be out of his House after
that time; which is to this Day most punctually
observed. The <em>Bostangi bashi</em>, who has
the Command of all the <em>Agiamoglans</em> in the
<em>Seraglio</em>, the <em>Topgibashi</em> or such great Officers
attended with a great Train of armed Men,
walking the Rounds, and drubbing such as
they find abroad at unseasonable Hours of
what Nation or Quality soever, except Physicians,
Chyrurgeons, and Apothecaries, whom
they allow at all times to visit the Sick.</p>

<p>The <em>Turkmans</em>, (for so they are peculiarly
called, as if they were the true Descendents
of the <em>Old Turks</em> or <em>Scythians</em>, whose
wandering kind of Life is described by the
Poet;</p>

<p>have no fixt Residence any where, but Travel
with their Families and Cattle from
Place to Place, carrying their Wives and
Children upon Camels; they pitch their
Tents usually near Rivers and Fountains, for
the convenience of Water, and according as
their necessities require, make a longer or a
shorter stay. Their whole Estate consists in
their numerous Flocks and Herds, which
they sell upon occasion to supply themselves
with what they want, at the Towns they
pass by. Their only concern is how to enjoy
the Benefits and Blessings of Nature, without
the troubles and turmoils and disquiets
of Life; being contented and happy in one
another's Company, void of all Ambition and
Envy, Courteous and Humane to Strangers,
that may want their Help and Assistance,
kindly entertaining them with such Provision
as their Folds afford. I have met with some
Companies of these harmless Wanderers in
my Travels. The Country lies open without
any Inclosures, and the Propriety not being
vested in any one, they Travel thro' the
Plains unmolested, and find excellent Pasturage
every where. The <em>Turks</em> Till no more Ground
than will serve their necessities: Being supplied
with Corn from <em>Ægypt</em>, and from <em>Moldavia</em>
and <em>Walachia</em>, by the way of the <em>Black
Sea</em>, letting vast Tracts of Ground lie wast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
and uncultivated; so that their Sloth herein
sometimes is justly punished with Dearths.</p>

<p>They have nothing to shew for their Houses
and Possession, but an <em>Hogiet</em> or piece of
Paper subscribed by the <em>Cadi</em>, if they have
acquired them by their Mony, or that they
were their Fathers before them.</p>

<p>The <em>Dervises</em> generally are Melancholy,
and place the greatest part of their Religion
in Abstinence and other Severities. Some
cut their Flesh, others vow not to speak for
six or seven Years, or all their Lives long,
tho' never so much provoked or distressed.
Their Garments are made of a course sort of
Wool or Goat's Hair: They are tied up by
the Vow of their Order ever from Marrying.
Several of this Sect in the heighth of their
Religious Phrenzy have attempted upon the
Lives of the Emperors themselves, (at whose
Government they have taken disgust) as
<em>Mahomet</em> the second, and <em>Achmet</em>, as if such
desperate Attempts were fatal to Bigots in all
Religions.</p>

<p>They pay a mighty Veneration to any Relique
of <em>Mahomet</em>, his Banner is still preserved
in the Treasury of the <em>Seraglio</em>, and is
look'd upon as the great Security of the
Empire. They believe that it was sent from
Heaven, and conveyed into the Hands of
<em>Mahomet</em>, by the Angel <em>Gabriel</em>, as a Pledge
and Sign of Success and Victory in his Battels
against the <em>Christians</em>, and all other Enemies
of the <em>Musulman</em>-Faith. It was sent to
<em>Candia</em> to encourage the Soldiers to endure
the fatigue of that long and tedious Siege;
and when it was brought thence after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Surrendry of that City, to be deposited in
its usual Place, the <em>Vizir</em> gave several <em>Christian</em>
Slaves, that row'd in the Galley that
was fraught with this Holy Ware, their Liberty.
They pretend to have some Rags of
<em>Mahomet</em>'s Vest, to which they ascribe great
Virtue. In confidence of which, the Emperor
<em>Achmet</em>, in the time of a great Fire
which raged at <em>Constantinople</em>, when all other
means fail'd, dipt part of them in Water to
be sprinkled upon the Fire to rebate the Fury
of it.</p>

<p>Next to the <em>Mufti</em> or <em>Cadaleskires</em> are the
<em>Mollas</em>, of which these four are the chiefest
in Dignity. The Molla of <em>Galata</em>, <em>Adrianople</em>,
<em>Aleppo</em>, <em>Prusa</em>; and after them are reckoned
these eight, <em>Stambol Ephendi</em>, <em>Larissa</em>, <em>Misir</em>
or <em>Cairo</em>, <em>Sham</em> or <em>Damascus</em>, <em>Diarbekir</em> or
<em>Mesopotamia</em>, <em>Cutaia</em>, <em>Sophia</em>, <em>Philippi</em>.</p>

<p>The Priests have no Habit peculiar to their
Profession, whereby they are distinguish'd
from others. If they are put from their
Moschs for miscarriage or neglect of doing
their Duty, or if they think fit to resign and
be Priests no longer, they may betake themselves
without any Scandal to secular Employments,
their former Character and Quality
wholly ceasing. While they remain
Priests, they counterfeit a more than ordinary
Gravity in their Discourse and Walking:
and affect to wear Turbants swelling
out, and made up with more cross folds:
which was all the difference which I could observe
by their Head Attire, which is various,
tho' I could not find that this was constantly
and strictly observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>In <em>Byram</em> time, which is the great Festival
of the Year, at which time every one
looks cheerfully and merrily, among other
signs of mutual Respect, they besprinkle one
another with sweet Water. They indulge to
several Sports: and some are mightily pleased
with swinging in the open Air, the ordinary
sort of People especially, paying only a
few Aspers for the diversion.</p>

<p>The Government is perfectly Arbitrary
and Despotical; the Will and Pleasure of the
Emperor having the force and power of a
Law, and oftentimes is above it. His bare
Command without any process is enough to
take off the Head of any Person, (tho' never
so Eminent in Dignity, tho' usually for
formality and to silence the Murmurings of
the Soldiery and People, the Sentence is confirm'd
by the <em>Mufti</em>) sometimes <em>Bassa</em>'s who
have amassed great Treasures in their Governments,
are cut off in their own Houses
in the midst of their Retinue, the Messengers
of Death producing the Imperial Command,
usually sent in a black Purse, and not
a Sword drawn in their Defence. Others,
if they are obnoxious to the least Umbrage
or Jealousie, tho' dismist the <em>Seraglio</em> with all
possible demonstrations of the Grand <em>Signior</em>'s
Favour, and with Rich Presents in order to
take possession of Places of great Command
in the Empire, before they have got two or
three Days Journey from <em>Constantinople</em>, have
been overtaken and strangled. In the Army
Commands are given according to Merit,
Courage and Conduct are sure to be rewarded,
the way lying open to the meanest Sol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>dier
to raise himself to be the chief of his
Order. But other Preferments depend upon
meer Chance, and upon the fansie of the
Emperor, whether the Person be fit or no,
and they are as soon lost. The least ill Success
or Miscarriage proves oftentimes fatal,
and a more lucky Man is put in his Place,
and he succeeded by a third, if unfortunate
in a Design, tho' managed with never so
much Prudence and Valour. They admit of
no hereditary Honours, and have no respect
to Descent or Blood, except the <em>Ottoman</em>
Family: He only is Great and Noble, whom
the Emperor favours, and while his Command
lasts. According to a tradition, that
passes current among them, a Bassa's Son by
a <em>Sultana</em> or a Daughter or Sister of the Emperor
can rise no higher than to be a <em>Sangiac-bei</em>
or Governor of some little Province, much
inferior to a Bassa and under his Jurisdiction.
Being born of Slaves for the most part, they
do not pride themselves in their Birth, very
few among them being scarce able to give any
account of their Grandfathers. They have no
Sirnames, but are distinguish'd by their Possessions
and places of Abode, and enjoying
by Law a Liberty of having what Women
they please, they have little or no regard to
Alliance or Kindred.</p>

<p>Their Empire owes the continuance of its
being to the severity of the Government,
which oftentimes takes place without regard
either to Justice or Equity, and to their frequent
Wars, which prevent all occasions of
Mutiny and Faction among the Soldiers,
which happen frequently when unimploy'd.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
So that tho' Ambition may put a warlike
Sultan upon enlarging his Territories by
new Conquests, yet reason of State forces a
weak and effeminate Prince, such as was <em>Ibrahim</em>,
to make War for his own Security.
Their Politicks are not owing to Books and
Study and the Examples of past times, but
to Experience and the plain Suggestions of
Nature and common Sense: They have Rules
of Government, which they firmly adhere
to, holding the Reins strait, especially being
cruel and inexorable to Criminals of
State, who never are to expect any Mercy or
Pity. Their Councils formerly were open,
and their Designs known, and proclaimed
before Hand, as if this had been a Bravery
becoming their Greatness, and that they
scorned to steal a Conquest. But they have
learned since the Art of dissimulation, and
can Lie and Swear for their Interest, and seem
excessive in their Caresses to the Ministers of
those Countries, which they intend to Invade.
But their preparations for Arming
are made with so much Noise, that an ordinary
Jealousie is soon awakened by it to oppose
them, in case of an Attack. They seldom
or never care to have War at both Extremes
of the Empire at the same time, and
therefore they are mighty sollicitous to secure
a Peace with <em>Christendom</em>, when they intend
a War upon the <em>Persians</em>: And as much as is
possible, they avoid quarrelling with two Christian
Princes at once, being usually at League
either with <em>Poland</em> and <em>Muscovy</em>, when they
War upon <em>Hungary</em>, and so on the contrary;
dreading nothing more than an Union of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
<em>Christian</em> Princes, bordering upon them, which
would prove so fatal to their Empire, and
quickly put a Period to their Greatness. For
hereby they would be put upon a necessity of
making a defensive War to their great Loss
and Disadvantage, and at last either be forced
to beg a Peace of the <em>Christians</em>, or run
the hazard of losing all, by a further Prosecution
of War.</p>

<p>This they are very sensible of, and therefore
as they take all occasion to promote
Quarrels and Dissentions in <em>Hungary</em> and
<em>Transylvania</em>, so they greatly rejoyce, when
the Princes of <em>Christendom</em> are at War one
with another. This is their great time of
Advantage, and they know that it is their
true Interest to pursue it, tho' they do not
always, by reason of the ill condition of
their own Affairs, make use of it. During
the Civil Wars of <em>Germany</em>, the Bassa's and
other Commanders of the Army were very
importunate with the grand Signior, to make
a War on that side, and to enlarge his Conquests
as far as <em>Vienna</em>, no conjuncture having
been ever so favourable to consummate
such a Design, in which <em>Solyman</em> so unhappily
miscarried. They promised him an easie
Victory, assuring him that the Animosities
of the Princes of the Empire were so heightned,
that there was no room left for a Reconciliation,
that he was but to go in the
Head of an Army to take Possession, and that
<em>Austria</em> would Surrender at the first News of
his March towards it. The Emperor was
not to be moved at that time by these Insinuations
and plausible Discourses; being con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>tinually
urged, He as often denied. One
day when they came to Renew their advice
about the <em>German</em> War, He having given order
before, that several Dogs should be kept
for some Days without Meat, commanded
that they should be brought out, being almost
Starved, and Meat thrown among them,
whereupon they snarled and bit one another:
In the midst of their Noise and Fighting,
he caused a Bear to be let loose in the same
Area; the Dogs forgetting their Meat, and
leaving off their fighting, ran all upon the
Bear, ready to Prey upon them singly, and at
last killed him. This Diversion the Emperor
gave his Bassa's, and left them to make the
application.</p>

<p>A certain Prophecy of no small Authority
runs in the Minds of all the People, and has
gain'd great Credit and Belief among them,
that their Empire shall be ruined by a Northern
Nation, which has white and yellowish
Hair. The Interpretation is as various as
their Fansie. Some fix this Character on the
<em>Muscovites</em>: And the poor <em>Greeks</em> flatter
themselves with foolish Hopes, that they are
to be their Deliverers, and to rescue them
from their Slavery, chiefly because they are
of their Communion, and owe their Conversion
to the <em>Christian</em> Faith to the Piety and
Zeal of the <em>Grecian</em> Bishops formerly. Others
look upon the <em>Swedes</em>, as the Persons describ'd
in the Prophecy, whom they are most to fear.
The Ground and Original of this fancy I
suppose is owing to the great Opinion, which
they have of the Valour and Courage of that
Warlike Nation. The great Victories of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
<em>Swedes</em> in <em>Germany</em> under <em>Gustavus Adolphus</em>
were loudly proclaimed at <em>Constantinople</em>, as if
there were no withstanding the shock and fury
of their Arms: And their continued Successes
confirmed the <em>Turks</em> in their first belief,
and their Fears and their Jealousies were augmented
afterwards, when <em>Charles Gustave</em>, a
Prince of as heroick a Courage, and as great
Abilities in the Art and Management of War
as the justly admired <em>Gustavus</em>, entred <em>Poland</em>
with his Army, and carried all before him,
seized upon <em>Warsaw</em> and drove <em>Casimire</em> out of
his Kingdom, and had almost made an entire
and absolute Conquest, only a few Places
holding out. This alarmed the Grand Signior
and the Bassa's of the <em>Port</em>, as if the Prophecy
were then about to be fulfilled, who did not
care for the Company of such troublesome
Neighbours, who might push on their Victories,
and joyning with the <em>Cossacks</em>, advance
their Arms further, and make their Country
the seat of a War, which might draw after it
fatal Consequences. To prevent which, Couriers
are dispatch'd from <em>Constantinople</em> to <em>Ragotski</em>,
Prince of <em>Transylvania</em>, then in concert
with the <em>Sweeds</em>, to Command him to retire
with his Army out of <em>Poland</em>, as he valued the
Peace and Safety of his own Country, and the
Friendship of the Grand Signior, whose Tributary
he was, and by whose Favour he had
gain'd that Principality: And the <em>Crim-Tartars</em>,
the Sworn Enemies of the <em>Poles</em>, who at
that time lay heavy upon them, were wrought
upon by the same Motives and Reasons of
State, to clap up a Peace with them, that being
freed from these Distractions, they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
unite their Forces the better together, and
make Head against the <em>Sweeds</em>.</p>

<p>The Ambassadors of <em>Christian</em> Princes, when
they are admitted by the Grand Signior to an
Audience, (their Presents being then of course
made, which are look'd upon as due, not to
say, as an Homage) are dismiss'd in few Words,
and referred by him to his <em>Wakil</em> or Deputy,
as he usually stiles the chief <em>Vizir</em>: And a small
number of their Retinue only permitted the
Honour of kissing his Vest, and then rudely
enough sent away.</p>

<p>The Grand Signiors keep up the State of
the old <em>Asiatick</em> Princes: They do not expose
themselves often to the View of the People,
unless when they ride in Triumph, or upon
some such solemn Occasion; when they go to
the Moschs, or divert themselves in the Fields,
either in Riding or Hunting, they do not love
to be stared upon, or approached. It is highly
Criminal to pry into their Sports, such an
Insolent Curiosity being often punished with
Death. The Story is Famous of <em>Morad</em>
the Third, who baiting a Bear in the old Palace
with a Mastiff, and espying three Fellows
upon the Tower of <em>Bajazid's</em> Mosch,
who had planted themselves to see the Sport,
commanded their Heads to be struck off immediately,
and be brought before him, which
was done accordingly. Instances of such
Capricio's are frequent in the <em>Turkish</em> History;
this following happened during my stay
at <em>Constantinople</em>.</p>

<p>Upon the return of Vizir <em>Achmet</em> from <em>Candia</em>,
after the Surrendry of that City, and a
happy end put by him to that tedious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
bloody War, he acquainting the present Emperor,
then at <em>Adrianople</em>, with the History of
that famous Siege at large, made such terrible
Representations of their and the <em>Venetians</em>
Mining and Countermining one another,
that the Emperor was resolved out of Curiosity
to see the Experiment made of a thing, that
seemed to him almost Incredible. A Work was
soon raised and undermined, and above 30
Murderers and Robbers upon the High-Way
and such like Villains were put into it, as it
were to defend it. The Grand Signior stood
upon an Eminence at some considerable distance,
expecting the issue of it; upon a Signal
given, the Mine was sprung, and the Fort
demolished, and the poor Wretches torn piece-meal
to his great Satisfaction and Amazement.</p>

<p>The Moon is the auspicious Planet of the
<em>Turks</em>: According to the course of which they
celebrate their Festivals. They begin their
Months from the first appearance of it, at
which time they choose, except a delay brings
a great Prejudice and Inconvenience with it,
to begin their great Actions. The Crescent
is the Ensign of the Empire, which they Paint
in Banners, and place upon the Spires of their
Moschs. Next to the Day of the appearing
Moon, they pitch upon <em>Friday</em>, to fight upon,
to begin a journey, and especially their Pilgrimage
toward <em>Mecca</em>, or do any thing of
great Consequence, as very lucky and fortunate.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Tadmor</em>
Castle.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Valley
of Salt.</div>

<p>Having promised you an Account of my
Voyage to <em>Tadmor</em>, I cannot now Excuse
my self from being as good as my Word,
whatever Censure I may incur of having
misspent my Mony and Time in search of
such unprofitable Curiosities; or what I more
fear, of having made such poor Improvements,
of which a Man of larger Reading
and Understanding, might have afforded
much greater Information. We departed <em>Aleppo</em>
on <em>Michaelmas-day</em>, 1691. and in six easie
Days Travel over a Desart Country, came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
to <em>Tadmor</em>; Journying almost continually to
the South, with very little variation to the
Eastward. As we rode into the Town, we
took notice of a Castle about half an
Hours distance from it, and so situated
as to Command both the Pass
into the Hills, by which we entred, and the
City too. But we could easily perceive it
was no Old Building, retaining no Footsteps
of the exquisite Workmanship and Ingenuity
of the Ancients. Upon Enquiry we
were informed, that it was built by <em>Man-Ogle</em>,
a Prince of the <em>Druces</em>, in the Reign of
<em>Amurath</em> the Third, <em>Anno D. N.</em> 1585. But I
know not how to give much Credit to this
Story, because I find not that either <em>Man-Ogle</em>,
or any <em>Drucian</em> Prince, was ever Powerful
in these Parts, their strength lying on
Mount <em>Libanus</em>, and along the Coast of <em>Sydon</em>,
<em>Berytus</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em> 'Tis a Work of more Labour
than Art, and the very Situation alone
is enough to render it almost Impregnable;
standing on the top of a very high Hill, enclosed
with a deep Ditch, cut out of the very
Rock, over which there was only one sole
Passage by a Draw-Bridge: This Bridge too
is now broken down; so that there is no Entrance
remaining, unless you will be at the
Pains to clamber up the Rock, which is in
one place feasible, but withal so difficult
hazardous, that a small slip may endanger
ones Life. Nor is there any thing within
to be seen sufficient to recompence
your Trouble of getting up to it, the Building
being confused, and the Rooms very ill
contrived. Upon the top of the Hill there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
is a Well of a prodigious depth, as certainly
it must be a great way to come at Water
from the top of such a Rock, the Ditch that
surrounds it, not having the least appearance
of moisture therein; which made it
therefore seem more strange that a Wild Boar
should rush out thence among our Horses,
when we rode up to take a more particular
View of the Place. This Castle stands on
the North side of the Town, and from hence
you have the best Prospect of the Country all
about. You see <em>Tadmor</em> under you inclosed
on three sides with long Ridges of Mountains,
which open towards the East gradually to
the distance of about an Hours Riding; but
to the South stretches a vast Plain beyond
the reach of the Eye. In this Plain you see
a large Valley of Salt affording
great quantities thereof, and lying
near about an Hours distance from
the City. And this more probably is the
Valley of Salt, mentioned 2 <em>Sam.</em> 8. 13. where
<em>David</em> smote the <em>Syrians</em>, and slew 18000
Men, than another which lies but four Hours
from <em>Aleppo</em>, and has sometimes past for it.
The Air is good, but the Soil exceeding barren,
nothing green to be seen therein, save
some few Palm-Trees in the Gardens, and
here and there about the Town. And from
these Trees I conceive is obtained its Name,
both in Hebrew (<em>Tadmor</em>) which signifies a
Palm-Tree, and in Latin (<em>Palmira</em>;) and
the whole Country is thence denominated
<em>Syria Palmirena</em>; and sometimes <em>Solitudines
Palmirenæ</em>: So that the Latins did not change
but only Translate the old Name, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
therefore still obtains in these Eastern Parts,
and the more Modern is wholly unknown.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Tadmor.</em></div>

<p>The City it self appears to have
been of a large Extent, by the space
now taken up by the Ruins; but
there are no Footsteps of any Walls remaining,
nor is it possible to judge of the ancient
Figure of the Place. The present Inhabitants,
as they are a Poor, Miserable, dirty
People, so they have shut themselves up, to
the Number of about Thirty or Forty Families,
in little Huts made of Dirt, within
the Walls of a spacious Court, which enclosed
a most Magnificent Heathen Temple.
Hereinto also we entred, the whole Power
of the Village, if I may so call it, being gathered
together at the Door, whether to
stand upon their Defence, in case we proved
Enemies, (for some of them had their
Guns in their Hands) or out of meer Curiosity
to gaze upon us, I know not. However our
Guide, who was an <em>Arab</em>, whom <em>Assyne</em><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
their present King had sent to Conduct us
through the whole Voyage, being a Man
known among them, we had an easie Admittance,
and with a great many Welcomes
in their Language were led to the <em>Sheck</em>'s
House, with whom we were to make our Abode.
And to mention here what the Place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>at first View represents. Certainly the World it
self cannot afford the like mixture of Remains
of the greatest State and Magnificence, together
with the Extremity of Filth and Poverty.
The nearest Parallel I can think of,
is that of the Temple of <em>Baal</em>, destroyed by
<em>Jehu</em>, and converted into a Draught-House,
2 <em>Kings</em> 10. 27. And if, what is not improbable,
this very Place was a Temple of <em>Jupiter
Belus</em>, the Similitude will run upon all Four.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Temple.</div>

<p>Being thus lodged within the
Place, I shall begin with a Description
thereof, and proceed to
what I observed remarkable without.
The whole inclosed Space is a Square
of 200 Yard each side, encompass'd with a
high and stately Wall, built of large square
Stone, and adorned with Pilasters within
and without, to the number, (as near as we
could compute by what is standing of the
Wall, which is much the greater part) of 62
on a side. And had not the Barbarity of the
<em>Turks</em>, Enemies to every thing that is splendid
and noble, out of a vain Superstition, purposely
beat down those beautiful Cornishes
both here and in other Places, we had seen
the most curious and exquisite Carvings in
Stone which perhaps the World could ever
boast of; as here and there a small Remainder,
which has escap'd their Fury, does abundantly
evidence. The West side, wherein
is the Entrance, is most of it broken down,
and near the middle of the Square, another
higher Wall erected out of the Ruins; which
shews to have been a Castle, strong but rude;
the old Stones and many Pillars broken or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
sawn asunder, being rolled into the Fabrick,
and ill cemented. Within were to be seen
the Foundations of another Wall, which
probably might answer this Front, and that
the <em>Mamalukes</em>, whose Workmanship it seems
most likely to have been, built the Castle here
for the Security of the Place. Before the
whole length of this new Front, except a
narrow Passage which is left for an Entrance,
is cut a deep Ditch, the ascent whereof on
the inner side is fac'd with Stone to the very
Foot of the Wall, which must have render'd
it very difficult to have assaulted it. The
Passage to, and the Door it self is very narrow,
not wider than to receive a loaded Camel,
or that two Foot-men may well walk
abreast. And as soon as you are within the
first Door, you make a short turn to the Right,
and pass on to another of the like bigness,
which leads into the Court. But all this is
but a new Building upon an old, and by this
outward Wall is quite shrouded that Magnificent
Entrance, which belonged to the first
Fabrick; of the stateliness whereof we were
enabled to judge by the two Stones which
supported the sides of the great Gate, each
of which is 35 Foot in length, and artificially
carved with Vines and clusters of Grapes,
exceeding bold and to the Life. They are
both standing, and in their Places, and the
distance between them, which gives us the
wideness of the Gate 15 Foot. But all this
is now walled up to the narrow Door before
mentioned. Over the little Door there is an
Inscription in <em>Greek</em>, and also another in another
Language and Character, which I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
saw till in <em>Tadmor</em>, nor understand what to
make of it. From that in <em>Greek</em> we hoped
for some Information; but it will be evident
to any one that reads it, that the Stone
was brought from another Place and casually
put in there. 'Tis thus:</p>

<p>ΤΟ ΜΝΗΜΕΙΟΝ ΤΟΥ ΤΑΦΕΩΝΟΣ ΕΚΤΙΣΕΝ
ΕΞ ΙΔΙΩΝ ΣΕΠΤΙΜΙΟΣ ΟΔΑΙΝΑΘΟΣ Ο
ΛΑΜΠΡΟΤΑΤΟΣ ΣΥΝΚΛΗΤ[ΙΚΟΣ] ΑΙΡΑΝΟΥ
ΟΥΑΒΑΛΛΑΘΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΝΑΣΩΡΟΥΑΥ ΤΩΤΕ ΚΑΙ
ΥΙΟΙΣ ΑΥΤΟΥ ΚΑΙ ΥΙΩΝΟΙΣ ΕΙΣ ΤΟ ΠΑΝΤΕΛΕΣ
ΑΙΩΝΙΟΝ ΤΕΙΜΗΝ.</p>

<p>Under this was the unknown Characters, which
I shall here give you a Specimen of, it being as
well as it could be taken, thus. <em>Vide Figuram.</em></p>

<p>The Letters between these [] Marks
were not Legible, but I have ventured to
supply the defect, as also you will see in some
others following. Neither was the Ε in
ΜΝΗΜΕΙΟΝ upon the Stone, but was
doubtless omitted by mistake; and the Inscription
is nothing else but the Inscription of
a Sepulchre, the like to which we saw several,
as I shall have occasion to mention some
of them hereafter. And as for the other
Character, it being added almost under every
<em>Greek</em> Inscription we saw, and rarely found
alone, I am apt to believe it the Native Language
and Character of the Place, and the
Matter it contains nothing else but what we
have in the <em>Greek</em>.</p>

<p>As soon as you are entred within the Court,
you see the Remainders of two Rows of very
Noble Marble Pillars 37 Foot high, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
their Capitals of most exquisite Carved
Work; as also must have been the Cornishes
between them, before by Rude and Superstitious
Hands they were broken down. Of
these there are now no more than 58 remaining
entire; but there must have been a great
many more, for they appear to have gone
quite round the whole Court, and to have
supported a most spacious double Piazza or
Cloyster. Of this Piazza the Walks on the
West side, which is opposed to the Front of
the Temple, seem to have exceeded the other
in Beauty and Spaciousness; and at each
end thereof are two Niches for Statues at
their full length, with their Pedestals, Borders,
Supporters, and Canopies, carved with
the greatest Artifice and Curiosity. The
Space within this once Beautiful Enclosure,
which is now filled with nothing but the
dirty Huts of the Inhabitants, I conceive to
have been an open Court, in the midst whereof
stands the Temple, encompass'd with another
row of Pillars of a different Order, and
much higher than the former, being above
50 Foot high. Of these remain now but 16,
but there must have been about double that
Number, which whether they enclosed an
inner Court, or supported the Roof of a
Cloyster, there being nothing now of a Roof
remaining, is uncertain. Only one great
Stone lies down, which seems to have reach'd
from these Pillars to the Walls of the Temple.
The whole Space contained within these
Pillars we found to be 59 Yards in Length,
and in Breadth near 28. In the midst of
which Space is the Temple, extending in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Length more than 33 Yards, and in Breadth
13 or 14. It points North and South, having
a most Magnificent Entrance on the
West, exactly in the middle of the Building,
which by the small Remains yet to be seen,
seems to have been one of the most glorious
Structures in the World. I never saw Vines
and clusters of Grapes cut in Stone, so Bold,
so Lively, and so Natural, in any Place:
And we had doubtless seen things abundantly
more curious, if they had not been
maliciously broken to pieces. Just over the
Door we could make a shift to discern part
of the Wings of a large Spread-Eagle, extending
the whole wideness thereof. The
largeness whereof led me at first to imagine it
might have been rather a Cherub over-shadowing
the Entrance, there being nothing of
the Body remaining to guide ones Judgment,
and some little Angels or <em>Cupids</em> appear still
in the corners of the same Stone. But afterwards
seeing other Eagles upon Stones
that were fallen down, I conclude this must
have been one likewise, only of a much larger
size. Of this Temple there is nothing
at present but the outward Walls standing,
in which it is observable, that as the Windows
were not large, so they were made
narrower towards the top, than they were
below; but all adorned with excellent Carvings.
Within the Walls, the <em>Turks</em>, or
more probably the <em>Mamalukes</em>, have built a
Roof, which is supported by small Pillars and
Arches; but a great deal lower, as well as
in all other respects disproportionate and inferior
to what the Ancient Covering must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
have been. And they have converted the
place into a Mosque, having added to the
South End thereof new Ornaments after
their manner, with <em>Arabick</em> Inscriptions and
Sentences out of the <em>Alcoran</em>, wrote in Flourishes
and Wreaths, not without Art. But
at the North End of the Building, which is
shut out of the Mosque, are Relicks of much
greater Artifice and Beauty. Whether they
were in the Nature of Canopies over some
Altars placed there, or to what other use
they served, I am not able to conjecture.
They are beautified with the most curious
Fretwork and Carvings; in the midst of
which is a Dome or Cupola, above six Foot
Diameter, which we found above to be of one
piece; whether hewn out of a Rock entire,
or made of some Artificial Cement or Composition,
by Time hardened into a Lapideous
Substance, seems doubtful; though I am rather
inclined to believe the latter. It is in
fine, a most exquisite Piece of Workmanship,
and on which I could have bestowed more
time to view it, than what was allowed us,
hastening to other Sights.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>A Mosch.</em></div>

<p>Having taken this Survey of the Temple, we
went Abroad, where our Eyes were presently
accosted with an amazing sight of a multitude
of Marble Pillars, standing scattered up and
down, for the space of near a Mile of Ground,
this way and that, but so disposed as to afford
no solid Foundation to judge, what sort of
Structures they formerly framed. I pass by
the Ruins of a Mosch, which directing
our Course Northward, was
the first thing occurr'd to our View,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
after we came out of the Court of the Temple,
which though of a more Artificial Frame
and Composure than many I have seen, yet
is not worthy to stop us in the way to things
both of greater Antiquity, and every way
more noble and worthy our Consideration.
Having therefore past this, you have the Prospect
of such Magnificent Ruins, that if it be
lawful to frame a Conjecture of the Original
Beauty of the Place, by what is still remaining,
I question somewhat whether any City
in the World could have challenged Precedence
of this in its Glory. But it being impossible
as they now stand to reduce them to
any regular Method, I must be forced to give
you a rude Account of them as they came in
sight; and which will fall much short of the
Greatness and Stateliness which they shew
to the Eye.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Obelisk.</div>

<p>Advancing then towards the
North, you have before you a very
tall and stately Obelisk or Pillar,
consisting of seven large Stones, besides
its Capital and a wreath'd Work above
it; the Carvings here, as in all other Places,
being extraordinary fine. The height of it
is above 50 Foot, and upon it I conceive may
have stood a Statue, which the <em>Turks</em>, zealous
Enemies of all Imagery, have thrown
down, and broken in pieces. 'Tis in compass,
just above the Pedestal, 12 Foot and a
half. On each Hand of this, towards the
East and West, you see two other large Pillars,
each a quarter of a Mile distant from
you, which seem to have some Correspondence
one to the other. And there is a piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of another standing near that of the East,
which would incline one to think there was
once a continued row of them. The height
of this to the East I took with my Quadrant,
and conclude to be more than 42 Foot
high, and the Circumference proportionable.
Upon the Body thereof is the following Inscription.</p>

<p>Η ΒΟΥΛΗ ΚΑΙ Ο ΔΗΜΟΣ ΛΛΙΛΑΜΕΝΑ ΠΑΝΟΥ
ΜΟΚΙΜΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΑΙΡΑΝΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΜΑΘΘΑ ΚΑΙ
ΑΙΡΑΝΗΝ ΤΟΝ ΠΑΤΕΡΑ ΑΥΤΟΥ ΕΥΣΕΒΕΙΣ

<p>I perswade my self it would be but lost
Labour to spend time in making Reflections
upon this or the following Inscriptions; as
for the Knowledge they may exhibit to the
World, your own Conjectures will more
happily lead you unto it, than any thing I
am like to suggest. It seems however pretty
evident they were a Free State, governed by
a Senate and People, though perhaps under
the Protection of great Empires, the <em>Parthians</em>,
it is probable, first, and afterward the
<em>Romans</em>, who for a long time contended for
the Mastery here in the East. And this Government
might continue among them till about
the time of <em>Aurelian</em>, who demolished
the Place, and led <em>Zenobia</em>, Wife of <em>Odenatus</em>,
Captive to <em>Rome</em>: Who, though she be
called Queen, yet I find not that ever her
Husband had the Title of King; but was on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>ly
one of the Chief Inhabitants, a Leading
Man in the Senate (as 'tis probable this <em>Alilamanes</em>
and <em>Airanes</em> were before him) who
while the <em>Romans</em> were busied in <em>Europe</em>, made
himself great here, and by his own Force repelled
the <em>Parthians</em>; who having Master'd
whatever was held by the <em>Romans</em> on the other
side of <em>Euphrates</em>, made an Incursion into
<em>Syria</em>, but were by <em>Odenatus</em> driven back
beyond the River. In the course of these
Wars <em>Odenatus</em> was slain, but his Wife <em>Zenobia</em>,
being a Woman of a Masculine Spirit, not
only kept her Ground against her Enemies
Abroad, but maintained her Authority at
Home, keeping the Government in her Hands.
Afterwards out of a desire to cast off the <em>Roman</em>
Yoke, she caused the whole Garrison,
which was left there by <em>Aurelian</em>, to be barbarously
cut off: Which bringing <em>Aurelian</em>
back with his Army, he quickly took the City,
and destroyed it, putting the Inhabitants
to the Sword, and carrying <em>Zenobia</em> Captive
to <em>Rome</em>; which was the Fatal Period of the
Glory of the Place. This Custom of theirs
of running up their Genealogies or Pedigrees
to the fourth or fifth Generation, shews them
to have borrowed some of their Fashions
from their Neighbours the <em>Jews</em>, with whom
it is not unlikely they had of old great Commerce;
and perhaps many of them were descended
from that People, <em>Zenobia</em> her self
being said to have been a <em>Jewess</em>; Or else
this must have been the manner of all the
Eastern Nations. Their <em>Æra</em> or Account of
Time they begin from the Death of <em>Alexander</em>
the Great, as the <em>Syrians</em> generally do;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the very Christians at this Day following the
same usage. Yet though they mark the Date
of the Year by <em>Greek</em> Letters, you may observe
they place them a different way from
the <em>Greeks</em>, setting the lesser Number first,
as if they were to be read backward, from the
right Hand to the left; as Ν Υ here, denoting
450. The third Letter Λ, I take to
stand for the Day of the Month, <em>viz.</em>
the last of <em>Xandicus</em>, which is with us <em>April</em>;
this and other names of Months, which are
found in other Inscriptions, being borrowed
from the <em>Macedonians</em> with very little variation.
That they were Idolaters, is plain by
the mention of their Country Gods, both
here and in other Places: So that their Commerce
with the <em>Jews</em>, did not, it seems, bring
them to the Knowledge of the true God, or
else they must have degenerated therefrom,
and relapsed into Idolatry. The other Pillar
towards the West in Height and Circumference
answers this, and has upon the side the
following Inscription engraved.</p>

<p>Η ΒΟΥΛΗ ΚΑΙ Ο ΔΗΜΟΣ ΒΑΡΕΙΧΕΙΝ
ΑΜΡΙΣΑΜΣΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΙΑΡΙΒΩΛΕΟΥΣ
ΚΑΙ ΜΟΚΙΜΟΝ ΥΙΟΝ ΑΥΤΟΥ
ΕΥΣΕΒΕΙΣ ΚΑΙ ΦΙΛΟΠΑΤΡΙΔΑΣ
ΤΕΙΜΗΣ ΧΑΡΙΝ.</p>

<p>The Date of this is not legible, neither
does one know what Judgment to make of
the thing it self. That such a Pillar should
be erected only to support the Inscription,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
and convey these Mens Names to After-Ages,
without particularizing what they did
to deserve that Honour, is something strange:
unless we may suppose it was a prevailing
Vanity in these Eastern Countries thus to endeavour
to Eternize their Fame. An Instance
whereof we have in Scripture, in <em>Absalom</em>'s
setting him up a Pillar, 2 <em>Kings</em> 18. 18.
and perhaps before him, in <em>Saul</em>, 1 <em>Sam.</em> 15.
12. Otherwise it may appear no improbable
Conjecture, that the Pillar was erected long
before upon some other Occasion, and afterwards
made use of to this end: And I look
upon it as past all doubt that several other
Inscriptions which we saw, were much more
Modern than the Pillars, on which they were
engraved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Piazza.</div>

<p>Proceeding forward, directly from
the Obelisk, about 100 Paces, you
come to a Magnificent Entrance,
vastly large and lofty, and for the
exquisiteness of the Workmanship not inferior
to any thing before described. I wish I
could add, that it had not suffered the same
Fate as the rest, and then we might have seen
a rare Piece of the Ancient Beauty of the
Place. This Entrance leads you into a Noble
Piazza of more than half a Mile long,
938 Yards according to our Measuring, and
40 Foot in breadth, enclosed with two rows
of stately Marble Pillars, 26 Foot high, and
8 or 9 about. Of these remain standing and
entire 129, but by a moderate Calculate
there could not have been less at first than
560. Covering there is none remaining, nor
any Pavement at the bottom, unless it be bu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>ried
under the Rubbish. But upon almost all
the Pillars we found Inscriptions, both in
<em>Greek</em> and the Language unknown, of which
we had time to take but very few, and those
not very Instructive. But such as they are
I'll present you them here, without observing
any other Order, but as they happened to be
transcribed.</p>

<p>I give you, Sir, these Inscriptions, as those
before, just as I found them, without any
Amendments, so much as of litteral Faults,
only where a Letter, or piece of a Word
was not legible, if I could make a probable
Conjecture what it should be, I have ventured
to add it. The last seems to have been put
up in Memory of an Embassy, performed by
those Men that are named therein, for settling
a Commerce and Traffick, which was
to their Satisfaction accomplish'd: But with
whom, till I can find out what Place is meant
by<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>ΟΛΟΓΕΣΙΑΔΑ, I must remain Ignorant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>I am unwilling to entertain any Thoughts of
<em>Getia</em> in <em>Macedonia</em>, or of <em>Olgassus</em>, a Place
mentioned by <em>Strabo</em> in <em>Bythinia</em>, which comes
a little nearer the Name, being both so remote,
and the City of <em>Tadmor</em> ill contrived
for a Place of Trade, being far from the Sea,
and without the Advantage of any River.
Yet the Magnificence of the Place shews
they have not wanted Riches among them:
And their Salt is a Commodity which still
brings them in a considerable Advantage.
The Order of the Numeral Letters you may
take notice is again inverted; but taking
them the right way, the Year 558 falls in
with the last Year of the Reign of <em>Alexander
Severus</em>, which is of our Lord 234.</p>

<p>About the middle of the Piazza, upon another
Pillar, was this following Inscription.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>This is as perfect an Inscription as any I
met with, by the help of which we may make
a Judgment of all the rest; at least thus far,
that they were put up in Memory of some,
who had behaved themselves, in those publick
Offices they bore, either in their own
Republick, or under the <em>Romans</em>, with Commendation;
this being a Publick Place, where
their Names and worthy Actions were Recorded
and Transmitted to Posterity. What I
further observed particularly in this, was the
want of the Name after ΙΟΥΛΙΟΥ, and took
notice of the like space vacant in the other
Language under it; and in both places it seemed
to be not worn out with Time, but voluntarily
scratch'd out. Which confirms me in the
Opinion that they are both one, and that the
unknown was the Vulgar, as the <em>Greek</em> was
the learned Language of the Place. Upon another
Pillar in the same Walk was this.</p>

<p>ΣΕΠΤΙΜΙΟΝ ΟΥΟΡΩΔΗΝ ΤΟΝ ΚΡΑΤΙΣΤΟΝ

<p>From another Pillar in the same Piazza was
Transcribed this broken Inscription which follows,
which I have endeavoured to make up
from the former, believing them in substance
the very same, with some little Alteration of
Names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>This is so like the preceeding, that I thought
I might fairly take the Liberty to make these
Additions to it. And what we may Collect
from both, and divers others of a like Import,
is, That as the State, the Senate, and People,
did sometimes Honour those that had been in
Publick Trust, with Inscriptions upon these
Pillars: So when this was not done by them,
private Persons had the Liberty to do the same
for their Friends. And I shall give you an Instance
by and by of one Engraven by a Husband
in Memory of his Wife. Upon several
of these Pillars are little Pedestals jetting out
about the middle of them, sometimes one way
only, and sometimes more, which seem to have
been the Bases or standing Places of Statues.
But none of these are remaining; neither is it
to be expected they should, in a place which
has been so long in the Hands of the <em>Turks</em>.
On these Pedestals we saw many Inscriptions,
sometimes when there were none upon the
Body of the Pillar, and sometimes when there
were. As for Instance this that follows upon
the Pedestal, thus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>ΣΕΠΤΙΜΙΟΝ ΑΙΡΑΝΗΝ ΟΔΑΙΝΟΘΟΥ ΤΟΝ

the Body of the Pillar this Imperfect one;
which I dare not venture to fill up, but shall
give it you as we found it.</p>

<p>We see they esteemed it very Honourable
to have their Memories preserved after this
manner; but it is but little Knowledge of
them we can get from hence, save now and
then the Time when they lived. As here, 563
Years after the Death of <em>Alexander</em> reach to
the Year of our Lord 239. Another Inscription
in the same Piazza was thus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>This affords a sufficient confirmation
of what I before observed, that these
were Honorary Inscriptions in Memory of
those that had behaved themselves well in
Publick Offices; of which we have several
mentioned here, whereof some are very well
known, but the others not easie to be met
with in Books. By the Word ΜΗΤΡΟΚΟΛΩΝΕΙΑΣ,
we may be assured that though the
City was reduced by the <em>Romans</em> into the form
of a Colony, yet it had a peculiar mark of
Honour set upon it, to signifie that it was the
chief of their Colonies in these Oriental Parts.
That the Authority also of their Senate and
People was continued to them. And besides
that there was a Society of Men, either Curators
of the Temple of <em>Jupiter Belus</em> (to
whom the Temple before described perhaps
was dedicated,) or Overseers of the Sports
and Festivals that were celebrated in Honour
of him; of which Sodality this <em>Septimius</em>
was, when this Inscription was made, a
<em>Symposiarch</em>, perhaps their Chief and Governour.
By this too we find they did not wait
for the Deaths of those they thus honoured,
before they provided for the Preservation of
their Memories; but Famous Men were thus
Registered for After-Ages even while they
were alive. Upon one of these Pedestals before
described, not far from the former, was
the following Inscription; which I valued the
more for the little remainder it has preserved
of the Name of <em>Palmyra</em>, by which the Place
was known to the <em>Romans</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>...ΥΠΙΛΙΟΝ ΟΥΟΡΩΔΗΝ [ΣΥΝΚΛ]ΗΤΙΚΟΝ ΚΑΙ

<div class="sidenote">The Banquetting-House.</div>

<p>The upper end of this spacious Piazza
was shut in by a row of Pillars,
standing somewhat closer than those
on each side; and perhaps there
might have been a kind of Banquetting-House
above, but now no certain Footsteps thereof
remain. But a little farther to the left Hand,
and, it may be, continued with the former
Walk, lie the Ruins of a very stately Building,
which I am apt to believe might have been for
such an use. 'Tis built of better Marble, and
has an Air of Delicacy and Exquisiteness in the
Work, beyond what is discernable in the Piazza.
The Pillars which supported it are of one
entire Stone; and on one of them that is fallen
down, but so firm and strong that it has received
no Injury thereby, we measured, and
found 22 Foot in length, and in compass 8 Foot
and 9 Inches. Among these Ruins we found the
only <em>Latin</em> Inscription we saw in the Place, and
that so imperfect, there is but little of it Intelligible.</p>

<p><em>......es Orbis &amp; Propagatores Generis Humani
D. D. N. N. <strong>Diocletianus</strong> ............ssimi
Impp. Et <strong>Constantius</strong> &amp; <strong>Maximianus</strong> Nobb.
Cæs. Castra feliciter condiderunt.</em></p>

<p>And upon the same Stone a little lower,</p>

<p><em>........ntes <strong>Ossiano Hieroclete</strong>, V. P.
Præs. Provinciæ D. N. M. O. Eorum.</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
The Name of <em>Maximianus Hercules</em>, who was
Partner in the Empire with <em>Dioclesian</em> which
should have followed in the Inscription, seems to
have been on purpose scratch'd out, and defaced,
for what reason I cannot guess. The rest
is lost by the breaking of the Stone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Palace.</div>

<p>In the West side of the great Piazza
are several openings for Gates leading
into the Court of the Palace: Two whereof,
one would easily believe when they were in
their Perfection, were the most Magnificent
and Glorious in the World, both for the Elegancy
of the Work in general, and particularly
for those stately Porphyry Pillars with which
they were adorned. Each Gate had four, not
standing in a Line with the others of the Wall,
but placed by couples in the Front of the
Gate, facing the Palace, two on one Hand, and
two on the other. Of these remain two entire,
and but one standing in its place. They are
about 30 Foot in length, and 9 in circumference;
of a Substance so exceeding hard, that it
was with great difficulty we broke off a few shivers
to bring home with us for a pattern of the
Stone, the Art of making which, I think is quite
lost. We saw several other broken pieces of Porphyry,
but neither of so accurate a Mixture and
Composition, nor so large as the former. The
hard Fate of one I could not but lament, when
I saw it debased to support the corner of a little
Hut, scarce good enough for a Dog-Kennel,
or a Hogsty. The Palace it self is so
entirely ruined, that no Judgment can be
made what it was in its Ancient Splendor, either
for the Figure or Workmanship thereof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
There is only here and there a broken piece
of a Wall remaining, beat into pieces by Violence,
and consumed by Time to that degree,
that without the help of Tradition we
could hardly be well assured, that a Royal Palace
did once fill that Space. We may guess
however that it fronted the Famous Piazza
before mentioned, and was surrounded with
rows of Pillars of different Orders, many of
which are still standing, some plain, and some
wrought and channell'd, as those immediately
encompassing the Temple. And upon those
little Pedestals which stood out of the middle
of some of them, I observed several Inscriptions,
but could not conveniently take more
than one, which together with the Pillar that
supported it was fallen to the Ground. 'Twas
this.</p>

<p>ΜΑΡΘΕΙΝ ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΥ ΤΟΥ
ΚΑΠΑΔΗΤΟΥ ΟΥΑΒΑΛΛΑΘΟΥ ΤΟΥ
ΣΥΜΩΝΟΥ ΣΟΡΑΙΧΟΣ ΑΙΡΑΝΟΥ
ΑΝΗΡ ΑΥΤΗΣ ΜΝΗΜΗΣ ΕΝΕΚΕΝ
ΜΗΝΕΙ ΔΥΣΤΡΩ ΤΟΥ Ϟ Υ ΕΤΟΥΣ.</p>

<p>If the rest were of a like Nature with this,
we have lost no great matter by not taking
them, this being only a Memorial, which a
kind Husband caused to be set up in Honour of
his Wife. The Month <em>Dystrus</em>, answers our
<em>March</em>, and the Year 490 from the Death of
<em>Alexander</em> the Great, the Year of our Lord 166.</p>

<p>I omitted to mention before, that under
the long Walk runs a Current of hot Sulphureous
Waters; and there is a Well and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Passages down to them. But whatever they
may have been of old, they are not now so
convenient as another about half a Mile Westward
from hence; where there is a very good
Descent into the Water, and it is still used
by the People to Bath in. Near to which,
upon the Pedestal of a broken Pillar, (or perhaps
it might be an Altar) remains this following
Inscription.</p>

<p>ΔΙΙ ΥΨΙΣΤΩ ΜΕΓΙΣΤΩ ΚΑΙ ΕΠΗΚΟΩ
ΒΩΛΑΝΟΣ ΖΗΝΟΒΙΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΑΙΡΑΝΟΥ
ΤΟΥ ΜΟΚΙΜΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΜΑΘΘΑ ΕΠΙ

<p>I am pretty confident that the Word I
have mark'd with a Line under it, is rightly
taken, and therefore know not what to
guess it to be, unless the proper Name of
the Fountain. And upon that Supposition
the Inscription is easily Intelligible, shewing
that <em>Bolanus</em>, Son of <em>Zenobius</em>, &amp;c. being
elected Overseer or Curator of this Fountain,
under <em>Jaribolus</em>, built this Altar to <em>Jupiter</em>,
in the Year of <em>Alexander</em> 474. <em>i. e.</em> of
our Lord 150. and on the 20<em>th</em> of <em>October</em>,
if the last <em>Kappa</em> be a Numeral, as I suppose
it must. But who this <em>Jaribolus</em> was, on whom
they bestow, as generally upon the <em>Roman</em>
Emperors, whose Names occur in the In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>scriptions,
the Title of ΘΕΟΣ, is not so facile
a Conjecture. They were under the <em>Parthians</em>,
before the <em>Romans</em> fell in amongst
them; but the Date shews this to be after
the time of <em>Hadrian</em>, and so after their
coming. Nay, and in an Inscription before
mentioned, which is of a later Date
than this by 88 Years, we have the Name of
the same Person. Hot Sulphureous Baths
are things very frequent in this Country;
and thence it was that it obtained the
Name of <em>Syria Salutifera</em>. The scent of the
Waters here is much like those of <em>Bath</em> in
<em>England</em>, but not so strong, neither is the
Taste so offensive. On the contrary, when
they have run so far from the Fountain, as
to become cold, they are very potable,
and are the only Waters the Inhabitants
use. But we, during our stay there, sent
to a Fountain of very excellent Water, about
an hour distant from the City.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The little
Temple.</div>

<p>On the East side likewise of the long Piazza
stands, if I may use such an Expression,
a Wood of Marble Pillars, some perfect,
and others deprived of their beautiful
Capitals; but so scattered and confused,
that it is not possible to reduce them into
any Order, so as to conjecture to what
they anciently served. In one place are
Eleven together in Square after this manner
<img src="images/117.png" height="32" alt="" />
 paved at the bottom with broad flat
Stone, but without any Roof or Covering.
And at a little distance from that stands the
Ruins of a small Temple, which
by the remains seems to have
been for the Workmanship very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
curious: But the Roof is wholly gone, and
the Walls very much defaced and consumed
with Time. Before the Entrance which
looks to the South, is a Piazza supported
by six Pillars, two on one Hand of the
Door, and two on the other, and at each
end one. And the Pedestals of those in the
Front have been filled with Inscriptions,
both in <em>Greek</em> and the other Language; but
they are now so obliterated and worn out,
as not to be Intelligible. The most perfect
was this that follows.</p>

<p>ΜΑΛΕΝΤΟΝ ΚΑΙ ΑΓΡΙΠΠΑΝ ΙΑΡΑΙΟΥ ΤΟΥ
ΡΑΑΙΟΥ ΓΡΑΜΜΑΤΕΑ ΓΕΝΟΜΕΝΟΝ ΤΟ
ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝ ΕΠΙΔΗΜΙ[Α] ΘΕΟΥ ΑΔΡΙΑΝΟΥ
ΑΛΙΜΜΑ ΠΑΡΑΣΧΟΤΑ ΞΕΝΟΙΣ ΤΕ, ΚΑΙ
ΠΟΛΕΙΤΑ[ΙΣ]...... And a little below were
these straggling Letters visible.</p>

<p>ΕΝΗ....Ν ΥΠΗΡΕΤΗΣΑΝΤΑ ΤΗΤ....
ΣΤΡΑΤΕΥΜΑ ΤΟΥ ... ΥΠΟ....ΗΚΑΙ.....ΤΟΝ
ΝΑΟΝ ΤΟΝ....ΔΙΟΣ....ΝΤΩΤ......</p>

<p>I should have imagined the ΚΑΙ to have
been a Copulative, and the second Name
<em>Agrippa</em> distinct from the former, but that
the Words following in the Singular Number,
will not admit of such a Construction. The Person
then in Memory of whom this Inscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
was made, must have been named <em>Malentus
Cæagrippa</em>, who bearing such an Office as
Scribe, or the like, in the Expedition of <em>Adrian</em>
the Emperor, performed an Act of Publick
Benificence and Generosity, both to
Strangers and Citizens, denoted by the Word<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
ΑΛΙΜΜΑ, or ἄλειμμα, which signifies Unction.
Perhaps he distributed amongst them
Sweet Oyls, to be used in or after their
Bathings. 'Tis pity what follows is so imperfect;
and especially that we cannot find
out the Date: For that might have directed
us to the precise time of <em>Hadrian</em>'s Expedition
into these Oriental Parts, where he made
great Conquests, and enlarged the Bounds of
the <em>Roman</em> Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sepulchers.</div>

<p>But as great a Curiosity as any
were their Sepulchers, being Square
Towers, four or five Stories high,
and standing on both sides of a hollow
way, towards the North part of the City.
They stretch out in length the space of
a Mile, and perhaps formerly might extend
a great way further. At our first view of
them, as we entred the place, we could not
conjecture what they were; some thought
them the Steeples of ruined Churches, and
were in hopes we should have found some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
footsteps of Christianity here. Others took
them to have been Bastions, and part of the
Old Fortifications, tho' there is not so much as
any Foundation of a Wall to be seen. But
when we came a Day or two after, more curiously
to enquire into them, we quickly found
their use. They were all of the same Form,
but of different Splendor and Greatness, according
to the Circumstances of their Founders.
The first we viewed was entirely Marble;
but is now wholly in Ruins, and nothing
but a heap of broken Stones, among which
we found the pieces of two Statues, one of
a Man, and another of a Woman, cut in a
sitting, or rather leaning posture; and the
Heads and part of the Arms of both being
broken off, but their Bodies remaining pretty
entire; so that we had the Advantage of
seeing their Habits, which appeared very
Noble, but more approaching the <em>European</em>
Fashion, than what is now in use in the East;
which inclined me to believe they might be
<em>Romans</em>. Upon broken pieces of Stone tumbled
here and there, we found some as broken
Inscriptions, but not affording any perfect
Sense, they are not worth the Transcribing.</p>

<p>Many other Sepulchers there were, as
much gone to decay as this, which therefore
we past by, to go to two, which stood almost
opposite to one another, and seemed most
perfect of any, though not without marks of
the <em>Turkish</em> Malice. They are two square
Towers, rather larger than ordinary Steeples,
and five Stories high, the outside being of
common Stone, but the Partitions and Floors
within of good Marble; and beautified too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
with very lively Carvings and Paintings, and
Figures both of Men and Women, as far as
the Breast and Shoulders; but miserably defac'd
and broken. Under these Statues, or
by their sides, are in the unknown Character,
the Names probably of the Persons
there buried, or by them represented; or
else some other Memorials of them. We
entred one of these by a Door on the South
side, from which was a Walk cross the whole
Building just in the middle. But the Floor
was broke up, and so gave us a sight of a
Vault below, divided after the same manner.
The Spaces on each Hand were again
sub-divided into six Partitions by thick Walls,
each Partition being capable of receiving
the largest Corps: And piling them one
above another, as their way appears to have
been, each of those Spaces might contain at
least six or seven Bodies. For the lowest,
second and third Stories, those Partitions
were uniform, and altogether the same; save
from the second Floor, which answered the
main Entrance, one Partition was reserved
for a Stair-Case. Higher than this, the
Building, being something contracted towards
the top, would not afford space for the
continuation of the same Method: Therefore
the two uppermost Rooms were not so
parted, nor perhaps ever had any Bodies
lain in them. Unless it was that of the
Founder alone, whose Statue wrapt up in
Funeral Apparel, and in a lying Posture, is
placed in a Nich, or rather Window in the
Front of the Monument, so as to be visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
both within and without. Near to this
Statue was the following Inscription.</p>

<p>ΤΟ ΜΝΗΜΕΙΟΝ ΕΚΤΙΣΑΝ
ΕΛΑΒΗΛΕΣ ΜΑΝΝΑΙΟΣ ΣΟΧΑΕΙΣ
ΜΑΛΧΟΣ ΟΥΑΒΑΛΛΑΘΟΥ ΤΟΥ
ΜΑΝΝΑΙΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΕΛΑΒΗΛΟΥ ΑΥΤΩ
ΚΑΙ ΥΙΟΙΣ ΕΤΟΥΣ ΔΙΥ ΜΗΝΟΣ
ΞΑΝΔΙΚΟΥ.</p>

<p>'Tis a little doubtful whether ΑΥΤΩ should
not rather be made ΑΥΤΟΙΣ; or else there
must be a Fault in the Verb, and all
those but the Names of one Person. The
other Monument on the other side of the way
is very much like this; only the Front and
Entrance are towards the North, and 'tis not
altogether so Polite, nor so well Painted. But
the Carvings are as good, and it shews altogether
as Stately and Magnificent as the former.
Besides, it has the Advantage in Age
of a whole Century of Years: As appears from
the Date of the following Inscription. 'Tis
placed above a Nich in the Front, adorned
with handsom Borders and Cornishes; the
place, doubtless, of some Statue, and probably
that of the Founder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>ΜΝΗΜΕΙΟΝ ΑΙΩΝΙΟΝ ΓΕΡΑΣ

<p>This is the most Ancient Inscription I met
with in <em>Tadmor</em>, the 314th. Year from the
Death of <em>Alexander</em> the Great, preceding
the Birth of our Saviour about Ten Years.
The other also is between Twenty and Thirty
Years before the Reign of <em>Hadrian</em>, and
consequently before the <em>Romans</em> got footing
here. And from these sumptuous Structures,
and these costly <em>Mausolæa</em>, we may
reasonably conclude, they were a Potent and
Opulent People, before they became subject
to the <em>Romans</em>, and were not obliged to them
for their Greatness.</p>

<p>And now I believe I have wearied you sufficiently
by leading you up and down the Ancient
and Famous City of <em>Tadmor</em>, and giving
you so dry an Account of our Employment
there. After 4 Days stay we returned, not the
way that we came, but proceeding Eastward
towards the River <em>Euphrates</em>. In our way to
which, the third Day, passing though a Village
called <em>Tieve</em>, upon a Stone set wrong
End upwards, in the midst of the Wall of
the Mosch, we met with the following Inscription.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>ΔΙΙ ΜΕΓΙΣΤΩ ΚΕΡΑΥΝΙΩ ΥΠΕΡ
ΣΩΤΗΡΙΑΣ ΤΡΑ: ΑΔΡΙΑΝΟΥ ΣΕΒ...
ΤΟΥ ΚΥΡΙΟΥ ΑΓΑΘΑΝΓΕΛΟΣ
ΑΒΙΛΗΝΟΣ ΤΗΣ ΔΕΚΑΠΟΛΕΟΣ

ΚΑΙ ΤΗΝ ΚΛΙΝΗ.... ΕΞ ΙΔΙΩΝ
ΑΝΕΘΗΚΕΝ ΕΤΟΥΣ ΕΜΥ ΜΗΝΟΣ
ΛΩΟΥ.</p>

<p>And under this was another in the same
Language and Character we had seen at <em>Tadmor</em>;
I was surprized to find such an Inscription
in this Place, nor can any way
guess how they should come by it: And the
mention of <em>Decapolis</em> makes me still more
in the Dark. If one might extend the
Bounds of <em>Decapolis</em>, as some are said to
have done, as far as <em>Cælosyria</em>, and comprize
under this Name again all <em>Syria</em>, <em>Phænicia</em>
only excepted, then need it not be brought
from elsewhere, but first set up in this
Village. But this will not be allowed by
those who make <em>Decapolis</em> only a part of <em>Palestine</em>.
The Matter of Fact it contains is
only an Account of the Magnificence of
this <em>Agathangelus Abilenus</em>, whoever he was;
who for the safety of the Emperor <em>Hadrian</em>,
erected at his own Charges, and Dedicated
to <em>Jupiter</em> the Thunderer, a Royal Ban<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>quetting-House,
(for so I take <a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>ΚΑΜΑΡΑ
to signifie) and a Bed of State; for after
ΚΛΙΝΗ there is doubtless a Letter omitted,
and it ought to be ΚΛΙΝΗΝ. The Date 445
agrees to the Year of our Lord 123. which
was the seventh of the Reign of <em>Hadrian</em>.
And the Month ΛΩΟΣ is our <em>August</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Arsoffa.</em></div>

<p>The next Day we past by the
Ruins of a large Monastery of the
<em>Maronites</em>, as I guess it to have
been by an Inscription we met with upon
the Capitals of several Marble Pillars,
which supported the middle Isle of a handsome
Church, which was to this effect.</p>

<p>† ΕΠΙ ΣΕΡΓΙΟΥ ΕΠΙΣΚ<sup>Ο</sup>. ΤΟΥ ΣΥΝΓΕΝ~
ΜΑΡΩΝΙΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΧΩΡΕΠΙΣΚ<sup>Ο</sup>.</p>

<p>From thence we past on, and came the
same Night to <em>Euphrates</em>, and having travelled
two Days on the Banks of that Famous
River, we came to the Tents of the
King of the <em>Arabs</em>, who had furnish'd us with
a Guide for our Voyage. With him we remained
two Nights, and in two Days Travel
more came back safe to <em>Aleppo</em>, having been
out in the whole just 18 Days.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p><em>The Reverend and Learned Author of this Account,
cannot with Justice be censured, if some

have escaped his Memory, being obliged to write
without recourse to the Books proper for his purpose,
which were not to be had in that Country. We have

<h2><em>An Extract of the Journals of two
several Voyages of the <strong>English
Merchants</strong> of the Factory of
<strong>Aleppo</strong>, to <strong>Tadmor</strong>, anciently
call'd <strong>Palmyra</strong>.</em></h2>


<p>Our Merchants of this worthy Factory,
being generally Men of more than
ordinary Birth and Education, have not been
wanting (as the intervals of leisure from
their gainful Traffick would permit) to make
Voyages of Curiosity, to visit the celebrated
Remains of Antiquity in those Parts, whereby
the once flourishing State of the World,
under the <em>Roman Empire</em>, is abundantly evinced.
And being inform'd by the Natives,
that the Ruins of the City of <em>Tadmor</em> were
more considerable than any they had yet seen,
they were tempted to enterprize this hazardous
and painful Voyage over the <em>Desart</em>; but
having been, by the perfidy of the <em>Arabs</em>,
disappointed of their Desires in their first
Attempt, they were obliged to defer their
Curiosity, till they could better provide for
their Security: whereof being assured, from
the Confidence some of them had in the
Friendship of <em>Assyne</em> then King of the <em>Arabs</em>,
they adventured again, in the Year 1691,
and had full liberty to visit, observe and
transcribe what they pleased.</p>

<p>What Account they there took, the Publick
has already seen in our Last, since which,
by the Favour of Mr. <em>Timothy Lanoy</em> and
Mr. <em>Aaron Goodyear</em>, two very Eminent
Merchants, who were both in the first
Voyage, we have received not only the
Draught of the Prospect of those noble Ruins,
taken upon the Place, (of which we
here give a Copy,) but also the Journals of
both the Voyages; which, for the Satisfaction
of the Curious, we have thought fit to
Publish.</p>


<h3><em>The first Voyage</em>, Anno 1678.</h3>

<p><em>July 18.</em> at Five in the Morning, we set
out from <em>Aleppo</em>, being sixteen <em>English</em>; but
with Servants and Mulettiers in all forty;
and in four Hours and an half, travelling
South by East, we arrived at a Village call'd
<em>Cafferabite</em>, being at the edge of the Desart,
here we reposed the rest of that Day.</p>

<p><em>July 19.</em> we rose at one in the Morning,
and directed our Course S. S. E. over the
Desart, for a Fountain call'd <em>Churraick</em>; but
our Guide losing his Way, there being no
Path, 'twas near Noon before we found it:
which made us doubt of our Safety. This
Well has no Signs near it to discover it by.
Here we pitch'd our Tents, and refresh'd our
Selves and Horses; and the Water being of
a Purgative Quality, made us some Diversion.
In our way, we found two <em>Arabs</em> with
two Asses, one whereof carried Water and
a little Bread, the other they rod on by
turns; they had one Gun, with which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
they shot Antelopes, the Bullet being a hard
Stone broken round, and cased with Lead;
they had on the Palms of their Hands, Elbows,
Knees and Feet, some Antelope-Skin
tied, that they may be able to creep the better
on the Ground, to Shoot; one of the
Asses walking by as a Stalking-horse, and
the <em>Arab</em> imitating the Cry of the Gazel till
he get within Shot: These <em>Arabs</em> are called
<em>Selebee</em>. At the Well came to us some <em>Arabs</em>
that were making Ashes of the ordinary sort
of Weeds call'd <em>Chuddraife</em>, <em>Ruggot</em> and <em>Cuttaff</em>;
these they cut and dry, and putting
them into a Pit, set Fire to them, and the
Ashes cake at the bottom. The Ashes they
carry to <em>Eglib</em> and <em>Tripoli</em>, to make Soap of:
But the best sort of Ashes are made of the
Weed <em>Shinon</em>, which grows about <em>Tadmor</em>, <em>Soukny</em>,
<em>Tibe</em> and <em>Yarecca</em>; it grows like Broom in
<em>England</em>, and in Shape resembles Coral.</p>

<p><em>July 20.</em> we rose at four in the Morning,
and Travelling two Hours E. S. E. we arrived
at <em>Andrene</em>, where we found the Ruins of
two or three Churches, and of a great Town
lying in a large Plain; where having tarried
about an Hour and an half, and taken
some fragments of Greek Inscriptions, which
afforded no certain Sense, but yet were evidently
Christian, we march'd again S. by E. and
in about four Hours time came to a pleasant
Aqueduct call'd <em>Sheck-alal</em>; this Aqueduct
is cut through the main Rock, for a
great way from the Mountains; and where
it ends, the <em>Arabs</em> have made a Garden,
which afforded us Melons, Cucumbers, Purslain,
<em>&amp;c.</em> In a Grotto hard by, there dwelt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
an <em>Arab</em> with his Family; he had a dozen
<em>Buffalo's</em>, which they used both for their Milk,
and to Plow the Ground, Sowing both Wheat,
and Barly: Hither the <em>Arabs</em> resort, when
they have committed any Robbery about <em>Aleppo</em>,
or <em>Hama</em>, and here they repose, and
divide the Spoil.</p>

<p><em>July 21.</em> we rose at four in the Morning,
and riding two Hours South, we came to a
Ruin call'd <em>Briadeen</em>; here we found the following
Inscription on a Stone, good part in
the Ground:</p>

<p class="center">ΑΦΙΕΡΩΘΗ ΑΑΙΛΥΝΔΙΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΑΜΦ ΕΤΟΥΣ<br />
ΔΙΑ ΜΑΤΕΡΝΟΥ ΚΑ(Ι Π)ΑΠΠΟΥ ΚΑΙ ΜΑΙΚΟΥ ΚΝΕΤΜΝ<br />
-------- Υ &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Ν
</p>

<p>From hence going South-East, in four Hours
more we came to a Well called <em>Costal</em> (which
signifies a <em>Spring in Arab</em>.) Most part of our
way through the Desart we were troubled
with <em>Rat-holes</em> in great numbers, like Coneyboroughs,
which by the sinking in of the
Earth, very much incommoded our Horses
and Mules. These <em>Rats</em> have at the ends of
their Tails a bush of Hair, and the <em>Arabs</em> eat
them all, excepting one part. From this
Well we arose about four in the Afternoon,
and began to ascend small Hills, covered with
Trees, which, for the most part, were the
small <em>Pistacho</em>'s which the <em>Arabs</em> pickle with
Salt; but eaten green, are good to quench
Thirst. We travelled on three Hours up
the Hills, where we pitch'd that Night, having
no other Water but what we carry'd
with us; and at Night we had a small Shower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
of Rain, a thing unusual in that Country at
that time of the Year.</p>

<p><em>July 22.</em> we rose by Two in the Morning,
and Travelling E. S. E. we came by Eleven
to a Well call'd <em>G'hor</em>, where we found it very
Hot, and saw several prints of Horses
Feet, so that we suspected some <em>Arabs</em> had
newly past that way.</p>

<p><em>July 23.</em> we rose by One in the Morning,
and Travelling most East, we came to a large
Plain, where we saw before us, on a high
Mountain, a great Castle, call'd by the <em>Arabs</em>
<em>Anture</em>. When we had travelled two or three
Hours in this Plain, we espied an <em>Arab</em> driving
towards us a Camel, with his Launce, so
fast, that he came on a round Gallop, and
we supposed him sent as a Spy: being come
up to us, he told us he was of <em>Tadmor</em>, and
that his Prince, the <em>Emir Melkam</em>, had that
Day made Friendship with <em>Hamet Shideed</em>
another Prince, and that together they had
four hundred Men; so he kept us Company
an Hour or two, and enquired of our <em>Mulettiers</em>
if we were not <em>Turks</em> disguised, with
intent to seize on <em>Melkam</em>; for we travelled
with a <em>Bandiero</em>, the Impress being a <em>Hanjarr</em>
or <em>Turkish</em> Dagger, and a Half-Moon. We
told him we were <em>Franks</em>, which he could
hardly believe, wondering that we travelled
thus in the Desart, only out of Curiosity.
Being come near to <em>Tadmor</em>, he went a little
before us, and on a sudden run full speed
towards the Ruins, we not endeavouring to
hinder him. Our Guide told us he was gone
to acquaint the <em>Arabs</em> who we were, and that
we ought to suspect and prepare for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
worst; so we dismounted twenty of our
Servants, each having a long Gun, and Pistols
at his Girdle, and placed them abreast
before us: we following at a little distance
behind, on Horse-back, with Carbines and
Pistols. In this order we proceeded, and
came to a most stately <em>Aqueduct</em>, which runs
under Ground in a direct passage five Miles,
and is covered with an Arch of Bastard Marble
all the Way, and a Path on both sides
the Channel for two Persons to walk abreast;
the Channel it self being about an <em>English</em>
Yard in breadth, and ¾ of a Yard in depth.
At 20 Yards distance all the way are Ventiducts
for the Air to pass, and the holes are
surrounded with small Mounts of Earth to
keep the Sand and Dust from falling down.
We marched close by these Mounts, which
might serve us for Defence, expecting every
moment that the <em>Arabs</em> would come to Assail
us, having the disadvantage of Sun
and Wind in our Faces: wherefore we Travelled
hard to gain an Eminence where we
might Post our selves advantageously, and
stop and repose a little, to consider what we
had to do. The <em>Arabs</em> finding us to come
on with this Order and Resolution, thought
not fit to adventure on us, so we gained the
Hill, from whence we might discern these
vast and noble Ruins, having a Plain like a
Sea for greatness to the Southwards of it.
Here having refresh'd our Men, we fetch'd a
little Compass and descended by the foot of
a Mountain, on which stands a great Castle,
but uninhabited. Here two <em>Arabs</em> came to
us with Lances, one being Chiah to <em>Melkam</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
and we sent two to meet them; they gave
the <em>Salam alika</em>, and ours returned the <em>Alica
salam</em>, and advancing to our Company, told
us the <em>Emir</em> had understood of our coming,
and had sent them to acquaint us that he was
our Friend, and that all the Country was
ours. We sent back with them our <em>Janizary</em>
and a Servant to visit the Prince in his
Tents, which were in a Garden. In the
mean time we dismounted at a watering
Place amidst the Ruins, but did not unload
till our <em>Janizary</em> and Servant returned with
the <em>Emir's Tescarr</em>, assuring us of Friendship
and Protection, a Writing which the <em>Arabs</em>
were never known to violate before. With
them came also one that belonged to the
<em>Sheck</em> of the Town, for whom we had Letters
from <em>Useffe Aga</em> the <em>Emeer</em> of <em>Aleppo</em>.
He desired us for greater Security to
pitch our Tents under the Town Walls,
which is in the Ruins of a great Palace, the
Wall yet standing very high, the Town within
but small, and the Houses excepting two
or three no better than Hog-sties. So we
pitched in a deep Sandy Ground where we
found it exceeding hot. Here we waited
till three of the Clock without eating any
thing, expecting the <em>Sheck</em> should have presented
us according to the usual Custom of
the <em>Turks</em> to their Friends, and have given
some answer to the Letters we brought him;
but on the contrary we found by the gesture
of the People, that we had Reason to suspect
them. Hereupon two of our Company
believing that the want of a present to the
<em>Emir</em> was the cause thereof resolved to ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>venture
to give him a Visit, and taking the
<em>Janizary</em> and one Servant, they carried him
a Present of two pieces of Red Cloath, and
four of Green, and several other things:
Being come he welcomed them into his Tent,
and placed the one on his right Hand and
the other on his left. <em>Melkam</em> was a young
Man, not above Five and Twenty, and well
Featur'd, and a most Excellent Horse-man;
<em>Hamet Shideed</em>, the other Prince, was more
elderly, as about forty Years of Age, and
was not in the Tent, but sat under a <em>Palm-Tree</em>
near it. He treated them with <em>Coffee</em>,
<em>Camel's-flesh</em> and <em>Dates</em>, and enquired of their
Journey, and the Cause of their coming:
They told him 'twas only Curiosity to see
those Ruins; he said that formerly <em>Solomon
Ibnel Doud</em> Built a City in that Place, which
being destroyed, was Built again by a strange
People, and he believed, that we understanding
the Writing on the Pillars, came to
seek after Treasure, he having but six
Moons before found a Pot of <em>Corra Crusses</em>.
After this he went out of the Tent, leaving
them smoaking Tobacco, to the <em>Janizary</em> and
Servant, and told them, that never till that
Day any <em>Franks</em> had been at that Place, and
that now we knew the way through the Desert,
we might inform the <em>Turks</em> to their Ruin
and Destruction, so that 'twould be convenient
for them to destroy us all: But that
we coming as Friends, he would only have
4000 Dollars as a Present, else he would hang
them and the two <em>Franks</em> up, and go fight
the rest. This Message being brought them,
they wish'd they had excus'd themselves from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
this Embassy, and answered, they could say
nothing to that Demand, not knowing our
Minds, but if he would permit them to go
and speak with the rest, they would return
an Answer. Hearing this, he threatened present
Death, but at length gave leave to our
<em>Janizary</em> to carry us a Letter from them,
wherein they shewed the danger they were in,
and earnestly entreated us to redeem them,
the Price set on them being 2000 Dollars,
one half in Mony, the other half in Goods,
as Swords, Cloaths, Tents, <em>&amp;c.</em> which the
<em>Emir</em> promised to estimate at their Worth.</p>

<p>This Letter amazed us mightily, and a little
before it arrived, we understanding a little,
and fearing more ill Treatment to our
Friends, were getting ready to free them or
die with them. The Garden where <em>Melkam</em>
lay, was about half a Mile from the Tents,
full of <em>Palm-Trees</em>, and had no Walls, but
loose Stones piled up Breast high about them,
so we designed to have gone suddenly and
given two or three Volleys on them, e'er they
could get to Horse; and the <em>Arab</em> know not
how to Fight on Foot. And though they
bragg'd they had 400 Men, we supposed 200
might be the most, and they not all Lances.
But on receipt of this Letter, and the Servants
telling us that they would certainly
be cut off, if we endeavoured their Rescue,
we began to examin what Moneys we had,
Cloaths and other Trade, and found we
could not near make up that Sum. In this
Confusion came two <em>Arabs</em> to receive the
things, and immediately Word was brought
that the <em>Emir</em> would come and Visit us; we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
sent him Word, that if he came with more
than two followers, we would not admit him:
so he came with 2 Servants only; and in conclusion,
we made him up in Money and
Goods to the Value of 1500 Dollars. He valuing
our Things as we pleased; his Design
being not so much to compleat the Sum, as
to take from us all we had. After this, about
Sun Set, he returned us our two Friends,
when the <em>Sheck</em> of the Town invited us to
Lodge within the Town; which we found afterwards
was with a design to have forced something
from us: But we giving him to understand
that the Emir had taken all already,
and had left us only our Arms and the
Cloaths on our Backs; which if they would
have, they must Fight for: That Resolution
daunted them, and away they went, promising
us Barley for our Horses in the Morning.
We kept good watch in the Night,
and when Day broke, we began to consider
how to clear our selves; we expected the
Barly till Nine in the Morning, when it
came, and the Emir himself came and gave
us the good Morrow: We feared least they
should pretend to stop some of us in the
Gate-way, so we placed six of our Company
to secure the Passage, 'till all the rest were
got out, under pretence of taking an Inscription
that was over the Gate. Being all
got clear, we returned by the same way we
came and arrived at <em>Aleppo</em> <em>July 29.</em> in the
Morning. This <em>Melkam</em> told us, That if
we had not submitted our selves to his Demands,
he was resolved to Fight us after this
Method: Loading 50 Camels with Baggs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Sand, and making small holes in the Baggs for
the Sand to drop out, he would drive these
Camels abreast upon us before the Wind, that
the Sand might blow in our Eyes, and we
spending our Bullets on the Camels, might
so be easily overthrown; we answered, that
we believed he would not venture his Camels
and Horses to such a Combat. He wondered
extreamly when we talk'd of Shooting
Birds flying, and Hares running.</p>

<p>This and other the like Violences used by
this <em>Arab</em> Prince, made the <em>Bassa</em> of <em>Aleppo</em>
resolve to destroy him; and not long after
he cajoled him with the Hopes of being
made King of the <em>Arabs</em>, and to draw him
near the City, he vested and caressed some
of his Followers: Which having its effect,
the <em>Bassa</em> surprized him in his Tents by Night,
and soon after he was put to Death: This
those People were willing to believe the effect
of their so abusing the <em>English</em>, and might
much contribute to the Security and good
Usage they found, that went the second time
on this Expedition.</p>

<p>We had not time to view these Ruins by
reason of this usage, though perhaps we
might with safety. We only took one of the
Inscriptions as we past by, which was thus.</p>

<p>Wherein the principal difference is in the
Word ἀραπήτην, which in the Account already
Published is read ἀράπετην, which seems to signifie
some peculiar Officer of the <em>Syrians</em>, as
<em>Ducenarius</em> of the <em>Latins</em>, which perhaps those
skill'd in the Oriental Customs and Languages
may be able to expound.</p>

<p>As far as we could conclude from our
Journeys, and the Position of the Ways taken
by two good Compasses, the Distance
of <em>Tadmor</em> from <em>Aleppo</em> is about a 150 English
Miles, and the Course S. S. E. or rather
somewhat more Southerly, considering the
Variation of the Compass, which is above a
half a Point Westward in these Parts.</p>


<h3><em>The second Voyage</em>, Anno 1691.</h3>

<p>We set out from <em>Aleppo</em> for <em>Tadmor</em> on
<em>Michaelmas-day</em>, being in all, Masters and
Servants, thirty Men, well armed, having obtained
a Promise of Security from <em>Assyne</em>,
then King of the <em>Arabs</em>, and one of his own
People for a Guide. This Day our Road
pointed S. b. E. and in four Hours we came
to a Fountain call'd <em>Caphir-Abiad</em>, leaving
Old <em>Aleppo</em> about an Hour distant on the
right Hand: Here we made but a very short
stay, but proceeded to a better Fountain
at the foot of a very high Hill, cover'd with
loose Stones, the Ruins of a Village called
<em>Broeder</em>, of which there was not one House
remaining; and dining here, we advanced
in an Hour and a quarter more, in the Afternoon,
through a fertile open Place, to a
Place called <em>Emghir</em>, famous for the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Wheat that is brought to <em>Aleppo</em>. This we
made our first Stage; and mounting again
in the Morning about five a Clock, in less
than an Hour, past by an uninhabited Village,
call'd <em>Urghee</em>, our Road pointing as
before, through the fruitful Plain, even and
pleasant; but when we came to ascend the
Hills, where I reckon'd we entred the Desart,
and were to take our leave of Mankind,
at least of an inhabited Country for
some Days, we had a troublesome Passage,
over loose great Stones, without any appearance
of a Road.</p>

<p>Our Guide had promised to conduct us
through pleasant Groves and Forests; but
no such thing appeared, unless we would
bestow that Name upon low withered Shrubs
that grew in the Way, only one Tree we
saw, which was of good use to us, serving
as a Land-mark; and when we were come
up with it, being left at a little distance on
the right Hand, we gain'd the Prospect of a
remote ridge of Hills before us, and on the
top of one of them an old Castle; this Castle,
we were told, was known by the Name
of <em>Gazar Ibn Wordan</em>; but what it anciently
was, or in what Condition it is at present,
I could not learn; therefore, not unwillingly,
I turned my Eyes from it, to a little
round Hill more on the left, by which we
were to direct our Course, and about a quarter
of an Hour from which stood a Sheck's
House, call'd <em>Sheck Ailha</em>, where we were to
bait, with a Well of Water by it, but such
that we had but little <em>gusto</em> to taste, though
it served our Horses: All the Country here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>abouts
is stor'd with <em>Antelopes</em>, and there is a
barbarous sort of People there, that have
hardly any thing else to live upon, but what
of these they can kill; and Necessity has
taught them to be no mean Artists in their
way, for they lie down behind the Stones,
and as the poor harmless Creature passes,
shoot them; and though their Guns be very
ordinary, exceeding heavy and thick, with
Match-Locks, yet are they such excellent
Marks-men, that they kill many. That
Morning we had Travelled about five Hours
to reach <em>Sheck Ailha</em>'s; yet finding nothing to
invite our stay there, (though there were four
or five Tombs there not ill made, according
to the <em>Turkish</em> mode) about one a Clock we
mounted again, bending to the S. E. or something
more Easterly. In our way we had
two remarkable Prospects, one on the right
Hand, of the Ruins of an ancient City call'd
<em>Andreen</em>, and sometimes <em>Londrine</em>, which we
were told had been formerly inhabited by
<em>Franks</em>, and that there were many Inscriptions
there; but it was too far out of our
way, and withal something too dangerous
too, for us to take a view of them: The other,
on the left Hand, was another Tree, not
far from which our Guide assured us of good
Water, where we designed to take up our
Lodging; the hopes of the Water made us
slight a Well we past by on the Road, at
which afterwards we repented we had not
stay'd; for when we came up with the Tree,
from which we had declined a great way to
the right, we found our Water still at a very
great distance, and were constrained to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
new Directions by a white chalky Hill, almost
as far as we could see, and yet not much
beyond the Place which was to be our Stage;
on therefore we proceeded till Sun-set, very
weary, and almost without hope of our coming
to Water that Night, though at the
same time near dead with Thirst; and which
the more supriz'd us, our Guide was advanced
a great way before, out of our sight,
upon what design we knew not, but at his
return, we found it was only to assure himself
better of the way, and in an Hours time
more he brought us to the side of a Bog,
call'd by the Name of <em>Zerga</em>, where, such as
it was, we found Water enough, but it was
neither palatable nor wholsome, neither did
the Ground seem proper to Sleep upon; yet
we were forced to be content, there being no
removing thence that Night.</p>

<p><em>October 1.</em> We departed from <em>Zerga</em>, about
two Hours before Sun-rise, and as soon as it
was light, had the Prospect of a very high
Hill, which was to be the bounds of our Travel
that Day. To this we made as directly
as we could look, finding nothing in our
way observable either to arrest our curiosity,
or to slacken our Pace, except a multitude of
Holes made in the sandy Earth, by Rats, Serpents,
and other Animals, which render'd
our Riding a little troublesome; as we had
found it upon the same Account the Afternoon
before. About two Hours short of our
Stage, we were shewn three little round Hills
lying to the right in a direct line, known by
the Name of <em>Tenage</em>; where we were told
there was good Water, and it's for that rea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>son
only they deserve the notice of those that
Travel through such a thirsty Desart. The
Place to which we directed our Course was
called <em>Esree</em>, where we arrived about eleven
a Clock, and found to our great Satisfaction,
that our Guide had not deceived us in his
Promise of excellent Water: Here we could
discern the Foundations of a spacious City,
and a piece of a thick Wall, built of a
chalky Stone, was standing: This we judged
to be the remainder of a Castle situated on
the side of the Hill, so as both to defend and
command the City. On the top of the Hill,
above the Castle, stands the Ruins of a Fabrick,
in appearance very Ancient, built of
very hard Stone, yet exceedingly worn by
the Weather; 'tis of an oblong Figure, pointing
near to the N. E. and S. W. with only
one Door on the Easterly end, which was
once adorned with extraordinary good Carvings,
of which there are still some remains,
but the greatest part is either worn away,
or purposely defaced; and those marks of ancient
Beauty that remain are very obscure,
and difficultly discernable; the outside of the
Walls is beautified with Pilasters quite round,
with their Pedestals and Capitals regular and
handsom; but the Roof is all fallen down,
and within appears nothing which looks either
great or beautiful. The Situation, and
placing the Door, hinders one from conjecturing
it to have been a Christian Oratory,
or Chappel, and therefore in probability it
must have been a Heathen Temple; and if
so, then the piece of the Castle Wall being
of a softer Stone, must be much more mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>dern;
the goodness of the Water brings the
<em>Arabs</em> (who rove up and down the Desart)
and the <em>Turk-men</em> frequently hither, which
has occasion'd a great many Graves about
the Temple; and some have had leisure, and,
(which is more difficult to be imagin'd) skill
enough to scratch in the Walls the first Letters
of their Names, and many more in Arabick
Characters, which we could make nothing
of, no more than of an Arabick Inscription
which lay hard by, but appeared
not ancient.</p>

<p><em>October</em> the 2d. We departed from <em>Esree</em>,
about an Hour, or an Hour and an half after
Midnight, and in six Hours and an half
arrived at two Wells, the Water 18 Fathom
and 2 Foot deep, known by the Name of
<em>Imp malcha Giub</em>: Through the greatest part
of this Stage we had a broad beaten Road,
and where that was not discernible, we guided
our selves by a ridge of chalky Hills, under
which the Wells lay; the Water we
found exceeding bad, and of so noisome a
Scent, that we could not endure it so much
as at our Noses; which made our Guide
laugh at us, who told us, the <em>Arabs</em>, and
even the King himself used to drink freely
of it; which, I am sure, our Horses would
not do, though they were under a necessity
of drinking that or none: For our selves
we had brought from <em>Esree</em> Water, sufficient
for one Day at least. In our way hither
we were shewn the true Plant which they
burn for Soap-Ashes, which has no Leaves,
but a soft juicy Stalk shooting into several
Branches, and something resembling our Cam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>phire,
only it's more round than that; the
Ashes likewise we saw, which were made not
far from the Wells, which in burning run
into Cakes, not much unlike the Cinders of
a Forge, only they are heavier, and not so
full of Pores, nor so hard as they are. In
the Afternoon, we proceeded on our Voyage
two Hours and an half, to a place called <em>Almyrrha</em>,
passing rather between than over the
Hills, though we had something of an ascent
too; this we did to shorten our Stage
the next Morning, for we were told before-hand
we should find no Water upon those
Mountains; so, for our Selves, we liv'd upon
our old Stock, and our Horses were constrain'd
to pass that Night without Water. Our
Journy hitherto had been altogether Southerly,
and but little varying to the Eastward
of due South.</p>

<p><em>October</em> the 3d. We mounted from <em>Almyrrha</em>
between five and six in the Morning,
making to the point of a high ridge of Mountains,
through an uneven Desart Way, frequently
interrupted with Gutts and Channels,
probably made by the descent of the
Waters from the Hills, upon sudden Rains:
We came to the ascent after about four Hours
Travel, which we found not difficult; and
when we were on the top, we had a pleasant
Prospect of the Country, and what we rejoyced
at most, we were shewn a little Hill,
just behind which, we were told lay <em>Tadmor</em>.
This Mountain was cover'd on both sides
with great plenty of Turpentine-Trees, which
was an Object very pleasing, having seen very
few greens in our whole Journey: This Tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
grows very thick and shady, and several of
them we saw loaded with a vast abundance of
small round Nut, the chief use whereof is to
make Oil, though some eat them, and account
them as great a Regalio as Pistaches;
their outward Husk is green, and more Oily
than that of Pistaches, and within a very
thin Shell is contained a Kernel both in colour
and relish very much resembling them;
but those that eat them, seldom take the
Pains to search for the Kernels, but eat
Husk and Shell all together, which have no
ungrateful Taste: From this Hill we had a
tedious descent, and coming at the foot into
a narrow Gut, winding this way and that
between the Mountains, our Passage seemed
very long, hot and tiresome; our want of
Water however obliged us to proceed, whereof
we now began to be in great necessity, especially
for our Horses and Mules, who had
none the Night before, nor none all that
Day; with this we had hopes of being supplied
two different ways; having had a shower
of Rain the Night before, we hoped to have
found Water standing in the hollows of the
Rocks; but either the Rain had not reach'd
so far, or not in such plenty as to fill those
naturally hewed Cisterns: Our other expectation
was from the Wells that were in the
Road; but these our Guide advancing before
and examining, met us with the unwelcome
News, that they were all dried up,
and the best Advice he could give us, was
to pitch where we were, and content our
selves with the remains of what we had
brought two Days in our Vessels, till our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Horses and Mules might be sent to a Fountain
two Hours out of our way, and being
watered there themselves, bring a fresh supply
for us: This way, with some difficulty,
we assented to, as more eligible, than weary
as we were, to wander so far out of the
Road, to have the same Ground to stage over
again the next Morning: We resolved therefore
to send our Guide, with one or two of
our Servants, in search of the Water, and
afterwards others with our Horses, while in
the mean time we pitch'd our Tents, it being
then about two a Clock in the Afternoon:
As soon as they were gone, a small drizzling
Rain, which we had about half an Hour, encreased
to a very plentiful Shower, which
put us upon producing all the Vessels we had
to catch it as it fell from the Heavens, or
ran down the Skirts of our Tents, our Horses
at the same time greedily drinking it from
the Ground; but we might have spared our
Pains, for in less than half an Hours time,
our Camp was in a manner a-float, and we
were surrounded with Water not only sufficient
for us, but for an Army of 20000 Men;
those hollow Gutts which we passed over
without the least appearance of moisture,
were, by the Cataracts which descended from
the Mountains, become Rivers; and our
Guide with those Servants we had sent out,
that before rode over it dry, it being swoln
to such a Torrent, were put to some difficulty
to repass it; so plentifully was God pleased
to provide for us in our greatest streight;
and which encreases both the Wonder and
Mercy, the next Morning, all this great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
quantity of Water was past away, so that in
about two Hour's Riding we could hardly
perceive that there had been any Rain at all.
This memorable Place is known by the Name
of <em>Al-Wishal</em>.</p>

<p><em>October</em> the 4th. From <em>Al-Wishal</em> we proceeded
for <em>Tadmor</em>, some of the Ruins of
which we perswaded our selves we could see
the Day before; perhaps it might be the
Castle, which is more than half an Hour's
distance from the City; our way lay Southward,
but the Gut in which we travelled
would not permit us to keep a direct course:
However, in about an Hour's Walk, we past
by <em>Antor</em> Mountains (our Guide call'd them
<em>Toul Antor</em>) through a Gut or Rent, both
sides of which so directly answered one to
the other, they would tempt a Man to believe
they were separated by Art, for an entrance
into the Country; but it must have
been a work of prodigious Labour and Charges
to have cut through such vast Mountains:
And if any one was so hardy as to
attempt it, he certainly grew weary of his
Undertaking; for the Ground is levelled
but a very little way, and almost as soon
as we were well got within the open space,
we were obliged to ascend another Hill, and
so our Road continued over Hills and Valleys
interchangeably all the way. On the
left Hand, some distance from the Road, we
saw a <em>Sheck</em>'s House on the top of a high
Hill, which made a better show than usually
those Buildings do, but being assured by our
Guide it was a modern Structure, and eager
too to come to the principal Place we aim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>ed
at, we would not prolong our Stage so
much as to turn out of the Road, to see
more of it: So pressing still forwards, we
had hardly proceeded four Hours, when we
came to the brow of a Rocky Mountain, separated
from that whereon stands the Castle
of <em>Tadmor</em>, but by a narrow Valley: In which
Hill, by the Way, appeared some Quarries
of fine Stone, which probably might afford
Materials to the curious Buildings in the
City. Our Guide here (according to his accustomed
Diligence) advanced some few Paces
before us, and having espied three or
four Country-Fellows driving Asses towards
us, he caused us to make halt, to give them
an opportunity to come nearer to us, resolving
to speak with them, to know whether
the Coast was clear, or if any of the Mountain
<em>Arabs</em> were then at <em>Tadmor</em>, or not.
After a little space, with our Arms in our
Hands, we marched in as good order as the
Way would permit, down a rocky and steep
Precipice, into the Valley; and our Guide
making greater speed than we could, gallop'd
after the poor affrighted Country Fellows;
who seeing such a Company unexpectedly
descend the Hill, left their Asses, and
fled towards the City with all possible speed:
But they were soon overtaken, and brought
back again to us; to whom they related the
good News, that there was no Force at all
in <em>Tadmor</em>, and that we might proceed with
Courage, and see what we would there with
all safety: Which News obtained them their
Liberty to go again to their Asses, and we
continued in our Way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>Having tired our selves with roving from
Ruin to Ruin, and rummaging among old
Stones, from which little Knowledge could
be obtained; and more especially not thinking
it safe to linger too long in a Place, where
should the Mountain <em>Arabs</em> (who were Enemies
to <em>Assyne Abasse</em>, our Friend) have Intelligence
of us, they might either fall upon
or endeavour to intercept us in our return;
(for which reason also we had all along concealed
our intended Course, under a pretence
of proceeding forward to <em>Damascus</em>.)
On <em>Thursday</em>, <em>October 8.</em> about half an Hour
after four in the Morning, we departed from
<em>Tadmor</em>, being very well satisfied with what
we had seen, and glad to have escaped so
dreaded a Place, without any Trouble or
Pretences upon us; but else with some Regret,
for having left a great many things behind,
which deserved a more particular and
curious Inspection. Our Road lay almost due
East, or a little inclining to the North; and
on the left Hand, a ridge of Hills stretched along
for a great space, sometimes about half
an Hour distant from the Road, and sometimes
opening wider: These Hills, we were told,
were stored with rich Veins of divers Minerals,
and afforded all that vast quantity of
Marble, the Remains whereof we had seen
at <em>Tadmor</em>; and it was from a Fountain call'd
<em>Abulfarras</em>, at the foot of one of them, they
fetch out Water, which we drank there;
the Inhabitants contenting themselves with
that which runs from the Hot Springs. To
the right Hand lay a vast barren Plain, perfectly
bare, and hardly any thing green to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
seen therein, except it were a few Gourds
which our Servants found on the side of a
little rising-Ground, where there was no
shew of any thing moist to feed them. Our
Way being plain, we had the sight of <em>Tadmor</em>,
especially the Castle, for above half our
Stage, till we came to an old <em>Caphar</em> House.
We made indeed a very short Days Journey,
in the whole, finding a Fountain of excellent
Water in about five Hours and a half's
Riding; which, as it was a most welcome
Refreshment to us in such a thirsty Desart,
so it was the only good Water we met with
till we came to <em>Euphrates</em>, which was not till
the third Day from this Place. At this Fountain
we pitch'd, near to which is a Village,
but almost wholly ruined and deserted. 'Twas
some time before any Body would be seen,
for they were afraid of us; at length, three
Men came out to our Tents, Spectacles of a
miserable Poverty, occasion'd by their being
frequently pillaged by the Mountain <em>Arabs</em>,
and a great Duty they pay to <em>Assyne Abasse</em>
their King, for his Protection: Three hundred
Dollars they pay him Annually, when
one would think the whole Village was not
able to make up the Sum of one Hundred;
yet being the remotest Place that was under
his Jurisdiction, they often suffer by the
Inroads of the other. The Name of the
Place is <em>Yarecca</em>, a Name it received (as
we were inform'd) from a Victory obtained
there by the <em>Turks</em> over the <em>Mamalukes</em>.</p>

<p><em>October</em> the 9th. From <em>Yarecca</em> we mounted
early, and Travelling N. E. or near that
Point, in seven Hours time arrived at <em>Souk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>ney</em>.
The Road we found much like what we
had the Day before, lying over a barren
Plain; only we had Hills on both sides, and
sometimes closing within half an Hours riding
one of the other. The Village has its
Name from the Hot Waters, (for so the
Word imports,) which are of the same Nature
with those of <em>Tadmor</em>; herein they Bath
frequently, the same little dirty Hole serving
both for Men and Women; only they
have so much Modesty remaining, that they
have different Hours for one and the other.
To say the Truth, 'twas the only mark of
Modesty I could observe among them; in
other respects they seemed a Confident, or
rather Impudent Generation of People. Before
we could pitch our Tents, they flock'd
about us in multitudes, Men, Women, and
Children; and of the last, many of them as
naked as ever they came into the World, not
so much as a Rag about them to cover them;
and so numerous they appeared, that if we
had reason to think <em>Yarecca</em> wanted Inhabitants,
we had no less, to conclude <em>Soukney</em>
over-stock'd. At this Place usually resides an
Officer of <em>Assyne</em>'s, who is their Sub-Basha,
or Governor: He whom we found there, was
call'd <em>Dor</em>, of a good Family among the
<em>Arabs</em>, to whom we made a Present; and he
civilly return'd it in Barley for our Horses.
Afterwards he came under our Tents, and
invited us to an Entertainment; which, considering
the Circumstances of the Place, was
very Splendid, though it was nothing but
<em>Pilaw</em> at last, a little diversify'd by the dressing;
and, to speak truly, I judge we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
not have less than a Bushel of Rice set before
us. His Palace, indeed was not very stately,
there being few Cottages in <em>England</em>
but might vie with it. To the Room wherein
we were entertain'd, which, doubtless,
was the best, if not the only one he had, we
were forced to clamber, rather than ascend,
by broken Steps made of Stone and Dirt.
When we were got in, and commodiously
seated after the <em>Turkish</em> Mode, it seemed
large enough for about a dozen or fourteen
People: At the upper end was a little space
separated from the rest by a ridge made up
of Earth, within which, I suppose, he slept.
The Walls were mean; but the Roof much
worse, having no other Covering but Faggots;
so that certainly it could not be Proof
against a Shower of Rain which fell that
Night, and forced us out of our Tents, into
in old ruinous <em>Cane</em>, for shelter: However,
it served well enough for our Afternoons Collation;
and we had come away with a good
Opinion of the Gentleman's Civility, had he
not afterwards endeavoured to make a Pretence
upon us, and so would have forced us
to pay dear for our Rice: He pretended to
a Customary Duty of a Chequeen a Head
of all <em>Franks</em> that past that Road; though
probably neither he, nor his Grand-father
before him, had ever seen a <em>Frank</em> there before.
But when he understood by our Guide,
that we were not so easily to be imposed upon;
and withal, that we were <em>Assyne</em>'s
Friends, and in our Way to his Tents; and
especially our Treasurer a Person he very
much esteemed, who therefore would be sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
to acquaint him with any Exaction or Injury
offer'd us, his Mouth was quickly stop'd, and
he grew so sensible of his Error, that he sent
to excuse it, and presented our Treasurer
with a Fan of Black Ostrich Feathers; and
not only so, but in the Morning came himself,
and begging Pardon, desired nothing
might be said of what had past, and so
conducted us about an Hour on our way. This
Village pays to <em>Assyne</em> fifteen hundred Dollars
<em>per Annum</em>.</p>

<p><em>October</em> the 10th. Continuing our Voyage
still to the N. E. or something more Easterly,
we found it another pleasant and easie Stage
to another Village call'd <em>Tiebe</em>, so called (as
they say) from the goodness of the Water,
the Word signifying <em>good</em>: But we found them
not so over excellent; they had the Tast,
and were doubtless tinctured with the same
Mineral, with those of <em>Soukney</em> and <em>Tadmor</em>,
though not so strong. But the Village it self
made a better Shew than usual; and the People
appear'd of something better Fashion,
and more civiliz'd, than those we had left.
It's pleasantly situated, and makes a good appearance
as one comes up to it; the Prospect
being helped by a well built Steeple, to which
is now adjoyned their Mosch: But I am apt
to believe it the remains of a Christian
Church, being built with more Art and Beauty
than you shall easily find in Turkish Fabricks:
And there are also several Ruins about
it, which speak it to have been a more
famous Place than now it is. Into the Mosch
we were permitted to enter, without any Disturbance.
This Village lies in one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Roads from <em>Aleppo</em> to <em>Bagdatt</em>, and pays to
<em>Assyne</em> an Annual Tribute of one thousand
Dollars. From hence we mounted again in
the Afternoon, and proceeded about two
Hours and a half farther, to shorten our
next Days Stage. Having travelled this Day,
in all, about seven or eight Hours, the Place
we pitch'd at was a Fountain, and known by
the Name of <em>Alcome</em>; but neither Town nor
House by it: neither was the Water fit to
be Drank, being of the same nature with that
of <em>Soukney</em>, and almost as warm.</p>

<p><em>October</em> the 11th. From <em>Alcome</em> we rose about
an Hour and an half after Midnight,
our Guide groping out the way, by the help
of the Stars, which now bended more to the
North than formerly. As soon as it was
light enough to look about us, we found our
selves in a wild open Desart, the Ground, in
some Places covered with a sort of Heath,
and in others quite bare. Nor had we travelled
long after the Sun was up, before, by
the help of a rising Ground, we discovered
<em>Arsoffa</em>, the Place whither we were tending,
which gave us hopes we should quickly be
there: But having a dry tiresome Plain to
traverse, and the hot Sun causing our Mules
a little to slacken their Pace, 'twas after ten
a Clock before we reach'd it: And which
was more vexatious still, finding no Water
any where near, we were necessitated to
proceed forward for the River <em>Euphrates</em>,
which we found four Hours distant from hence.
<em>Arsoffa</em>, or (as the <em>Arabs</em> call it) <em>Arsoffa Emir</em>,
seems to be the remains of a Monastery, having
no Town nor Village near it, and being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
one continued Pile of Building of an oblong
Figure, stretching long ways East and West,
and enclosing a very capacious Area: At a
distance it makes a glittering shew, being
built of <em>Gypsine Stone</em>, or Rock-Ising-glass,
resembling Alabaster, but not so hard; several
Quarries of which we past by in our
way to it. When the Sun shines upon it, it
reflects the Beams so strong, that they dazzle
the Eyes of the Spectators. Art or Accuracy
in the Workmanship we found none;
and but very little Carved Work, and that
mean enough; nay, the very Cement they
made use of, is but little better than Dirt;
so that it's no great Wonder to see it in Ruins,
though it has not the appearance of any
great Antiquity. Round about were the
little Apartments or Chambers for the Monks,
built Arch-wise, only one Story above
Ground; but underneath are several Cells
or Vaults, larger than the Chambers, which
perhaps might serve for their Schools, or
Working-houses. In the midst of the Area
stand the Ruins of several Buildings, some
of which seem to have been Cisterns for Water,
and it may be the Bathing-Places: But
the most remarkable was one, which probably
was the Abbot's or Bishop's House,
there having been something more Pains bestow'd
upon it, than the rest: And another,
which was the Relicks of their Church. This
was formerly no unhandsom Structure, being
built in the form of our Churches, and distinguish'd
into three Isles, of which the middle
one is supported by eighteen turned Marble
Pillars, with Capitals upon them, not of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Marble, but of a sort of Clay, and Cast into
the shape they are in, but of a Colour
exactly resembling the Pillar it self. That
which perswades to believe them Cast, is
a Greek Inscription to be seen on all of them;
the Letters whereof are not made by Incision
in the Stone, but seem to be stamped,
standing out higher than the distance between
them; and on one of them, by mistake,
they are so placed, as to be read after the
Oriental manner, from the right Hand to
the left. The Words are these, with the
Crucifix before, as follows:</p>

<p>✠ ΕΠΙ ΣΕΡΓΙΟΥ ΕΠΙΣΚ<sup>Ο</sup>. ΤΟΥ ΣΥΝΓΕΝ
ΜΑΡΩΝΙΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΧΩΡΕΠΙΣΚ<sup>Ο</sup>.</p>

<p>From hence our Guide led us to the River,
by the assistance of two little Hills, which
are known by the Name of <em>Aff Dieu</em>, our
way lying North, and a little bending to
the East. The sight of the River was a very
pleasing Prospect; and to our great comfort,
we found the Water very clear, happening
to be there before the Rains, and after
the Snow-Waters (which swell and disturb
it in the Summer-time) were all past:
And our Happiness seemed the greater, having
had so tedious and thirsty a Journey
of at least fourteen Hours, and neither our
Selves nor our Horses touch'd a drop of Water
all Day. We pitch'd upon a Reach of the
River, where it was not very broad, not being
above half a Musket-shot over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p><em>October</em> the 12th. This Morning, about
Sun-rise, we proceeded on our Voyage, keeping
along the Banks of the River, which, for
the most part, led us West and North-West:
And here we had pleasant Travelling, having
the River on the right Hand, and Hills
of Marble or other fine Stone, on the left;
and delightful Groves of Tamarisk, Mulberry,
and other Trees to pass through.
Here every thing about us lookt fresh and
verdant, and we met frequently Men and
Women passing on their Occasions, a thing
to which (in our former Stages) we had not
been accustomed. We had also a pleasing
Prospect of the opposite Shore, and could
see a great way into <em>Mesopotamia</em>, but could
meet with no Convenience to cross the River,
which we were very desirous to have
done. There are no Places of Note remaining
upon the River either on one side or the
other, only on the farther side we saw an old
Castle call'd <em>Giabar</em>, which made a good Shew,
being situated on the top of a Hill, and both for
that and the way of Building, very much resembling
that of <em>Aleppo</em>, only that is the
larger, and in the midst of a City; this less,
and has neither Town nor Houses about it.
On our side we past by a <em>Sheck</em>'s House call'd
<em>Abul-Rarra</em>, and the Ruins of a Town a little
farther, where there was a square Tower
built of a very ordinary Brick, but pretty
entire. After we had left these Ruins, we
rested to bait, under the Shadow of a Rock,
wherein were many Apartments and Conveniences
cut to lodge in, which I suppose are
made use of in the Winter by the People,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
who, during the Summer, pitch among the
Trees by the River-side. In the Afternoon
we continued our Journey as before, keeping
always at a little distance from the River,
till a little before Sun-set; when we came to
a very convenient Place upon the Banks,
where we took up our lodging for that Night,
having travell'd between seven or eight Hours
the whole Day.</p>

<p><em>October</em> the 13th. This Day we had the
same Satisfaction as the Day before, proceeding
as near the River as the Road would
permit; and having made a Stage of about
six Hours, we rested under the shade of the
Tamarisk Trees by the River side, hoping to
have found conveniency to have crossed it, but
we could not. In our Way we saw nothing
observable but the Ruins of a City call'd
<em>Baulas</em>, where the <em>Turks</em> had formerly a <em>Sangiack</em>;
but now there is never an Inhabitant
in the Place, nor House standing, but the
Ruins of Houses, and an Octagonal Tower
of a considerable height, <em>viz.</em> One hundred
and seven Steps, and beautified on the outside
with Flourishes and an Arabick Inscription
round about: It's a handsome Structure,
and probably the Work of the <em>Mamalukes</em>,
since whose time little has been done to adorn,
but abundance to destroy and wast
this Country. After Dinner, we mounted
sooner than ordinary; because hoping to
reach the Tents of <em>Assyne</em>, we were unwilling
it should be late when we arrived: yet
we made it near Sun-set before we got to
<em>Fay</em>, a Fountain by which he lay. We had
travell'd still on the same Point N. W. with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the Prospect of the River the greater part
of the Way; the nearest Reach thereof not
being above an Hours Riding from the Fountain.
On the Road we met with several <em>Bandera</em>'s
of the <em>Emir</em>'s Soldiers, who knowing
our Guide, and understanding we were going
to him, gave us a very courteous <em>Salam</em>, who
else, perhaps, might have treated us with
another sort of Civility. The King's Tents
spread over a large Plain, and took up so
vast a Space, that though we had the advantage
of a rising Ground, we could not see the
uttermost extent of them. His own particular
Tent was pretty near the middle of the
rest, which were pitch'd about it, not in a
circular manner, but stretching out in length
as the Plain open'd, or for the better conveniency
of a Current of Water, which from
the Fountain ran through the midst of them.
'Twas not at all distinguishable from the rest,
but by its bigness, and a little more Company
about it, being all made of a sort of
Hair-Cloth, which seemed hardly a defence
against Rain or Sun: But certainly they must
find otherwise, else their Necessity (they
spending their Lives in such moveable Habitations)
would have taught them to have
contrived something better. It cannot well
be doubted but they are descended from the
old <em>Arabs Scenitæ</em>, they living just after the
same manner, having no settled Abode, but
remove from Fountain to Fountain, as they
find Grass for their Sheep and Camels, and
Water for them and themselves. They love
to derive themselves from <em>Ismael</em> the Son of
<em>Abraham</em>; and it may be they are descended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
from him, but I believe they would be hard
put to't to prove their Pedigree.</p>

<p>As soon as we alighted, we were attended
by the Officers of the <em>Emir</em>, and conducted to
a very noble Tent built after the <em>Turkish</em>
Mode, and pitch'd next to his own. Hither
he sent to bid us welcome, and to enquire
how we had past in our Voyage; and presently
after we had a Repast of several Dishes
of Meat set before us, to stay our Appetites
till a more plentiful Supper could be
got ready. But before Supper the King
himself made us a Visit in Person, bidding us
Welcome to <em>Fay</em>, and asking what we had
seen in our Travels that pleas'd us? how we
liked <em>Tadmor</em>? and whether we had found a
Treasure there? For this Notion sticks in
the Heads of these People, That the <em>Franks</em>
go to see old Ruins, only because they there
meet with Inscriptions which direct them to
some hid Treasures. And therefore it's no
unusual thing with them, when they find a
Stone with an Inscription on one side, to turn
that down to the Ground, that it might not
be seen or read of any. But we assur'd him
we went with no such Expectations, but only
out of a desire to see the Place: Neither
had we brought any thing away with us; but
a piece of Porphyry Stone, which, upon his
Request, we shew'd him. We let him see
too, a kind of rude Draught which we had
taken of the Place; which he seemed to like.
He made his Visit the shorter, that he might
not incommode us after our Journey; but desir'd
us we would live after our own Pleasure
and to our Satisfaction, and command freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
whatever the Camp would afford; ordering
some of his People constantly to attend upon
us. When there was mention made of our
Design to be gone the next Morning, he answer'd,
It must not be; himself was invited
the next Day, to a great Entertainment, by
one of his <em>Grandees</em>, and we should accompany
him: But the Day following, he would
go out with us, and Hunt part of our Way
towards <em>Aleppo</em>. When Supper was brought
in, there was Victuals enough for three times
our Number: A large Dish of <em>Pilaw</em> in the
middle, and twelve or fifteen Dishes of several
sorts of Meat about it, all dress'd after
their manner, but exceeding good, and such
as one might have fed heartily upon, had he
not spoil'd his Appetite before. After we
had Eat and Drank what we pleas'd, we
rose up, and our Servants sat down in our
Places; it being the Custom of the <em>Arabs</em>,
and <em>Turks</em> too, from the Highest to the Meanest,
all to eat at the same Table: The best
sort sit down first, and so in order till all are
satisfy'd, and then what remains is carry'd
away. We might, if we had pleas'd, have
lodg'd under the same Tent where we eat;
but having Tents of our own pitch'd, some
of our Company chose rather to retire thither,
to avoid being disturbed by too many
Visitants.</p>

<p><em>October</em> the 14th. The next Morning, about
ten a Clock, we were told that the
King was gone to the Entertainment, and
expected we should follow him; and that two
young Camels were kill'd, to furnish this
sumptuous Feast; which is the highest piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
of Magnificence and Greatness to which these
People, whose greatest Riches consist in
Camels, can arrive. The Tent was about a
Furlong from ours; so mounting our Horses,
we rode to it, and found it surrounded
with a numerous train of Guests, three hundred
at least, of different Sort and Quality:
It was very large of it self, and to be still
more capacious, 'twas left open toward the
West. The King was seated at the North-end,
about the midst of the Tent, upon a Place
raised with Cushions and Quilts, and Carpets
before him: Neither did he sit cross-Legg'd,
as all the rest of the Company were
obliged to do, but in a leaning Posture.
They seemed to observe an exact Order in
their Places; and when any Person of Note
enter'd, those that were near his Place, rose
up and stood till he had seated himself. But
the far greatest part could not come within
the compass of the Ring, but stood behind
the Backs of the rest, leaving a spacious
<em>Area</em> vacant in the middle. When we entred,
they made room for us on the King's left
Hand, which here is esteem'd the more Honourable;
where we sat down in the same
Posture with those about us, cross-Legg'd
upon a thin Carpet. Before mid-day, a Carpet
being spread in the middle of the Tent,
our Dinner was brought in, being served up
in large Wooden Bowls between two Men;
and truly to my apprehension, Load enough
for them. Of these great Platters there
were about fifty or sixty in number, perhaps
more, with a great many little ones, I mean,
such as one Man was able to bring in, strew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>ed
here and there among them, and placed
for a Border or Garnish round about the
Table. In the middle of all was one of a
larger size than all the rest, in which was the
Camel's Bones, and a thin Broth in which
they were boiled: The other greater ones
seemed all filled with one and the same sort
of Provision, a kind of Plumb-Broth, made
of Rice, and the fleshy part of the Camel,
with Currants and Spices, being of something
a darker Colour than what is made
in our Country. The lesser were, for the
the most part, charged with Rice dress'd
after several Modes, some of them having
<em>Leben</em>, (a thick sour Milk) poured upon
them. <em>Leben</em> is a thing in mighty Esteem
in these Hot Countries, being very useful
to quench Thirst: And truly we had need
of it here; for I did not see a drop of any
sort of Liquor, excepting a Dish of Coffee
before Dinner, drank at this splendid Feast.
Knives, Forks, Spoons, Trenchers, <em>&amp;c.</em> are
silly Impertinent Things in the Esteem of the
<em>Arabs</em>: However, we being known to make
use of such things, had large Wooden Spoons
laid before us. When the Table was thus
plentifully furnish'd, the King arising from
his Seat, went and sat down to that Dish
that was directly before him; and so did
the rest, as many as it would contain, which
could not be much short of a hundred;
and so without further Ceremony, they fell
to thrusting their Hands into the Dishes,
and Eating by Handfuls: Neither was there
any occasion of Carving; only because those
Dishes in the middle were too remote to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
be reach'd, there was an Officer on purpose,
who stepping in among them, and standing
in the Spaces designedly left for that
end, with a long Ladle in both his Hands,
helpt any one according to their Desire.
When the King had eaten what he thought
fit, he rose up and wash'd, and retir'd back
to his former Seat; and we also did the
like; others being ready to fill our Places.
Nor did we continue much longer under
the Tent in that numerous Crowd; for <em>Assyne</em>
perceiving us a little uneasie, and supposing
we had now sufficiently satisfy'd
our Curiosity, though perhaps not our Appetites,
told us we might take our Liberty,
and if we thought fit retire to our
Tents. This Favour we gladly accepted,
and without Ceremony returned, several
of his Attendants waiting upon us back.
Here we had another Dinner set before
us; and having some of our own Wine
and Water to Drink with it, it went down
better with us than the famous Camel-Feast.
In the Evening, the King mounted to see
the flight of a new Hawk, and stay'd Abroad
very late, his Hawk flying away:
But she was afterwards taken up by his Falconer;
otherwise he had not been in a good
Humour all that Night, being a Man that
delights very much in Sport. After his return
from Hawking, we went to Wait upon
him at his own Tent, to return him Thanks for
his most courteous and royal Reception of us,
and to desire leave to depart the next Morning.
Here we found him surrounded with
the chiefest of his People; and being pla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>ced
again on his left Hand, he entertain'd
us with a great deal of pleasant Discourse;
and ask'd such Questions, as shew'd him to
be a Man of extraordinary Capacity and
Judgment. As for Learning, they have no
such thing among them, and therefore it's
not to be expected that he should be a Scholar:
But were he not a Person of more than
common Prudence and Understanding, he
could never have managed that Wild and
Unruly People as he has done, ever since
his Advancement to the Throne; which
must therefore have been the more difficult,
because as he came to it by the Deposition
of his Father (though not immediately)
who now lives with him as a private Man,
so has he never wanted Competitors. To
his Father he pays a great deal of outward
Respect, but is forced to keep a very watchful
Eye over him. After about an Hours
Discourse, we were dismiss'd.</p>

<p><em>October</em> the 15th. In the Morning, <em>Assyne</em>
not being at leisure to go a Hunting, we
proceeded on our Voyage Homewards, with
a great deal of Alacrity; and finding nothing
remarkable in our Road, in about 3
Hours and an half arrived at <em>Seray</em>. And
hence, after a short Repast, we continued
our Journey to <em>Sherby</em> Fountain, which took
us up about the like space of Time. Here
we accounted our selves as good as at Home,
being at a Place with which we were well
acquainted, and to which several times in
the Year some or other of our Nation usually
resort, either for Antelope or Hog-hunting,
according to their Season; nor had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
we hence above seven or eight Hours to
<em>Aleppo</em>.</p>

<p><em>October</em> the 16th. Getting up pretty early
in the Morning, we resolved to Hunt
the greatest part of our Way Home, as we
did; and Dining at the famous <em>Round-Hill</em>,
whereon has been spent by the <em>English</em> more
Money than would purchase a noble Estate
round about it, in the Afternoon we arrived
safe at <em>Aleppo</em>.</p>

<h2><em>Some Account of the Ancient State
of the City of <strong>Palmyra</strong>, with
short Remarks upon the Inscriptions
found there. By <strong>E. Halley</strong>.</em></h2>


<p>The City of <em>Tadmor</em>, whose Remains
in Ruins do with so much evidence
demonstrate the once happy Condition thereof,
seems very well to be proved to be the
same City which <em>Solomon</em> the great King of
<em>Israel</em> is said to have founded under that
Name in the <em>Desart</em>, both in 1 <em>Kings</em> 9. 18.
and 2 <em>Chron.</em> 8. 16. in the Translation of
which, the <em>Vulgar Latin Version</em>, said to be
that of St. <em>Jerom</em>, has it, <em>Condidit Palmyram
in Deserto</em>. And <em>Josephus</em> (in <em>lib.</em> 8. <em>Antiq.
Jud.</em> wherein he treats of <em>Solomon</em> and his
Acts) tell us, that he Built a City in the Desart,
and called it <em>Thadamora</em>; and the <em>Syrians</em>
at this Day (says he) call it by the same
Name; but the <em>Greeks</em> name it <em>Palmyra</em>. The
Name is therefore Greek, and consequently
has no relation to the Latin <em>Palma</em>, and
seems rather derived from Παλμυός or Πάλμυς,
which <em>Hesychius</em> Interprets βασιλεὺς πατὴρ: or
perhaps from Παλμύτης, which (according to
the same Author) was an <em>Egyptian</em> God. Neither
is the Word תרמר but תמר that in Hebrew
signifies a <em>Palm-Tree</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>History is silent as to the Fate and Circumstances
of this City, during the great Revolutions
in the several Empires of the East;
but it may well be supposed, that so advanced
a Garrison as this was, being above three
hundred Miles from <em>Jerusalem</em>, continued
not long in the Possession of the <em>Jews</em>, who
immediately after <em>Solomon</em>, fell into Civil
Dissention, and divided their Force: so that
it is not to be doubted, but that it submitted
to the <em>Babylonian</em> and <em>Persian</em> Monarchies,
and afterwards to the <em>Macedonians</em> under
<em>Alexander</em> and the <em>Seleucidæ</em>. But when the
<em>Romans</em> got footing into these Parts, and the
<em>Parthians</em> seemed to put a stop to their farther
Conquests in the <em>East</em>, then was this
City of <em>Palmyra</em>, by reason of its Situation,
being a Frontier, and in the midst of
a vast Sandy <em>Desart</em>, where Armies could not
well subsist to reduce it by Force, courted
and caressed by the contending Princes, and
permitted to continue a Free State, a Mart
or Staple for Trade, for the Convenience of
both Empires, as is abundantly made out
from the Words of <em>Appian</em> and <em>Pliny</em>.</p>

<p><em>Appian</em> (<em>lib.</em> 5. <em>de Bellis Civil.</em>) tells us, that
<em>M. Antonius</em>, after his Victory at <em>Philippi</em>, about
forty Years before <em>Christ</em>, sent his Horse
to Plunder the City of <em>Palmyra</em>, pretending
only that they were not sufficiently in the
<em>Roman</em> Interest. ὅτι Ρωμαίων καὶ Παρθυαίων ὄντες
ἔφοροι ἐς ἑκατέρας ἐπιδεξίως εἶχον, and that being
Merchants, they conveyed the <em>Indian</em> and
<em>Arabian</em> Commodities by the way of <em>Persia</em>
into the <em>Roman</em> Territories; though the true
reason were their Riches: But the <em>Palmyrenes</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
being informed of the Design, took care to
prevent them, and so escaped Plunder: And
this Attempt of <em>Antony</em>'s occasioned a Rupture
between the two Empires. The Words
of <em>Pliny</em> (<em>lib.</em> 5. <em>Nat. Hist.</em>) above an hundred
Years after, do likewise testifie that this City
then continued in the same Enjoyment of
their Liberties. They being very much to
the purpose, I thought fit to Copy them:
<em>Palmyra Urbs nobilis situ, divitiis soli atque
aquis amœnis, vasto undique ambitu arinis includit
agros, ac velut terris exempta à rerum Natura;
privata sorte inter duo imperia summa
Romanorum Parthorumque, &amp; prima in discordia
semper utrinque cura</em>. Whereby it appears not
only that it was a Common-wealth in the
time of <em>Vespasian</em>; but the situation thereof
is truly described, as it were an Island of
fertile Land, surrounded with a Sea of barren
Sands. Such Spots <em>Strabo</em> tells us were
frequent in <em>Lybia</em>, and by the <em>Egyptians</em> were
called <em>Abases</em>; whence possibly the Name of
the <em>Abassyne</em> Nation is derived.</p>

<p>With these Advantages of Freedom, Neutrality
and Trade, for near two Centuries,
'tis not strange that it acquired the State
and Wealth answerable to the Magnificence
of these noble Structures. But when the <em>Romans</em>
under <em>Trajan</em> had made it appear, that
there was no comparison between the Puissance
of the <em>Parthians</em> and them, (<em>Trajan</em> having
taken <em>Babylon</em> and <em>Ctesiphon</em> the then
Seat of the <em>Parthian</em> Empire,) the <em>Palmyreni</em>
were at length determined to Declare for
the <em>Romans</em>; which they did, by submitting
themselves to the Emperor <em>Adrian</em>, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the Year of Christ 130, when <em>Adrian</em> made
his Progress through <em>Syria</em> into <em>Egypt</em>. And
that Magnificent Emperor being highly delighted
with the native Strength and Situation
of the Place, was pleased to adorn and
rebuild it: When, as 'tis likely, he bestowed
on it the Privileges of a Colony <em>Juris Italici</em>,
which it enjoyed (as <em>Ulpian</em> assures us.) And
the Inhabitants of the City, in Gratitude,
were willing to call themselves <em>Hadrianopolitæ</em>,
ἐπικτισθείσης τῆς πόλεως ὑπὸ τοῦ Αὐτοκράτορος (says
<em>Stephanus</em>.) Nor is it unlikely that many of
those Marble Pillars were the Gift of that
Emperor, and particularly those of the Long
<em>Porticus</em>; for that none of the Inscriptions
are before that Date. And it was usual for
the <em>Cæsars</em> to present Cities that had obliged
them, with Marble Pillars to adorn their
Publick Buildings. These here were not far
to fetch, the Neighbouring Mountains affording
<em>Marble-Quarries</em>: But the Magnitude
of the <em>Porphyry</em> Columns is indeed very remarkable,
considering how far those vast
Stones must have been brought by Land-carriage
to this Place; it being not known
that any other Quarries yield it, except those
of <em>Egypt</em>, which lie about mid-way between
<em>Cairo</em> and <em>Siena</em>, between the <em>Nile</em> and the
<em>Red-Sea</em>: The Stone being very valuable for
its Colour and Hardness, and so that it rises
in Blocks of any magnitude required;
<em>Quantislibet molibus cædendis sufficiunt Lapidicinæ</em>,
(<em>Plin.</em> <em>lib.</em> 36.) And it is a great mistake
of those who suppose it fictitious.</p>

<p>From the time of <em>Adrian</em> to that of <em>Aurelian</em>,
for about an hundred and forty Years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
this City continued to flourish and encrease
in Wealth and Power, to that degree, that
when the Emperor <em>Valerian</em> was taken Prisoner
by <em>Sapores</em> King of <em>Persia</em>, <em>Odænathus</em> one
of the Lords of this Town (which Name
occurs in several of these Inscriptions) was
able (whilst <em>Gallienus</em> neglected his Duty both
to his Father and Country) to bring a powerful
Army into the Field, and to recover
<em>Mesopotamia</em> from the <em>Persians</em>, and to penetrate
as far as their Capital City <em>Ctesiphon</em>.
Thereby rendring so considerable Service to
the <em>Roman</em> State, that <em>Gallienus</em> thought
himself obliged to give him a share in
the Empire: Of which Action, <em>Trebellius Pollio</em>
(in the Life of <em>Gallienus</em>) has these Words,
<em>Laudatur ejus (Gallieni) optimum factum, qui,
Odenatum participato Imperio Augustum vocavit,
ejusque monetam, qua Persas captos traheret,
cudi jussit: quod &amp; Senatus &amp; Urbs &amp; omnis
ætas gratanter accepit</em>. The same in many
Places speaks of this <em>Odænathus</em> with great
Respect; and mentioning his Death, he
says, <em>Iratum fuisse Deum Reip. credo, qui interfecto
Valeriano noluit Odenatum reservare</em>. But
by a strange reverse of Fortune, this Honour
and Respect to <em>Odænathus</em> occasioned the
sudden Ruin and Subversion of the City. For
he and his Son <em>Herodes</em> being murder'd by
<em>Mæonius</em> their Kinsman, and dying with the
Title of <em>Augustus</em>, his Wife <em>Zenobia</em>, in Right
of her Son <em>Waballathus</em> then a Minor, pretended
to take upon her the Government of
the East, and did administer it to admiration:
And when soon after <em>Gallienus</em> was
murder'd by his Soldiers, she grasped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Government of <em>Egypt</em>, and held it during the
short Reign of the Emperor <em>Claudius Gothicus</em>.
But <em>Aurelian</em> coming to the Imperial
Dignity, would not suffer the Title of <em>Augustus</em>
in this Family, tho' he was contented
that they should hold under him as <em>Vice Cæsaris</em>;
as plainly appears by the Latin Coins
of <em>Aurelian</em> on the one side, and <em>Waballathus</em>
(which Name is often found in these Inscriptions)
on the other, with these Letters
V. C. R. IM. OR., which <em>P. Harduin</em> has
most judiciously interpreted <em>Vice Cæsaris Rector
Imperii Orientis</em>, but without the Title of <em>Cæsar</em>
or <em>Augustus</em>, and with a Laurel instead
of a Diadem. But both <em>Waballathus</em> and <em>Zenobia</em>
are stiled ΣΕΒΑΣΤΟΙ in the <em>Greek</em>
Coins, made, 'tis probable, within their own
Jurisdiction. Two of the <em>Latin</em> I have seen,
and they are as described, excepting the
Points.</p>

<p>But nothing less than a Participation of
the Empire contenting <em>Zenobia</em>, and <em>Aurelian</em>
persisting not to have it dismembered: He
marched against her, and having in two Battles
routed her Forces, he shut her up and
Besieged her in <em>Palmyra</em>: And the Besieged
finding that the great resistance they made,
availed not against that resolute Emperor,
they yielded the Town; and <em>Zenobia</em> flying
with her Son, was pursued and taken: With
which <em>Aurelian</em> being contented, spared the
City, and leaving a small Garrison, march'd
for <em>Rome</em> with this Captive Lady: But the
Inhabitants believing he would not return,
set up again for themselves, and (as <em>Vopiscus</em>
has it) slew the Garrison he had left in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Place. Which <em>Aurelian</em> understanding, tho'
by this time he was gotten into <em>Europe</em>, with
his usual fierceness, speedily returned; and
collecting a sufficient Army by the way, he
again took the City without any great Opposition,
and put it to the Sword, with an
uncommon Cruelty, as he himself confesses
in a Letter (extant in <em>Vopiscus</em>), and delivered
them to the Pillage of his Soldiers. And
it is observable, that none of the Greek Inscriptions
are after the date of this Calamity,
which befell the City in or about the Year
of <em>Christ</em> 272, as far as may be collected, after
it had been nine or ten Years the Seat of
the Empire of the East, not without Glory.</p>

<p>In this appears also the great utility of
Coins to illustrate Matters of History; for
by them alone 'tis made out, that there was
such a Prince as <em>Waballathus</em>, <em>Vopiscus</em> singly
mentioning him by the Name of <em>Balbatus</em>.
And from the same Coins it appears, that
<em>Odænathus</em> had the Title of <em>Augustus</em> four
Years, and <em>Waballathus</em> six at least; and that
the first Year of <em>Aurelian</em> was the fourth of
<em>Waballathus</em>. And by the Testimony of <em>Pollio</em>,
<em>Odænathus</em> was declared Emperor of the
East, <em>Gallieno</em> &amp; <em>Saturnino Coss.</em> which was <em>Anno
Christi</em> 263, and died before <em>Gallienus</em>, but
in the same Year, <em>viz.</em> <em>Anno</em> 267, which, by
the Coins, was the first of <em>Waballathus</em>. He
therefore immediately succeeded <em>Odænathus</em>,
and was without doubt his Eldest Son by <em>Zenobia</em>,
and not his Grandson the Son of <em>Herodes</em>,
as some learned Men have supposed:
For if <em>Zenobia</em> could not endure that <em>Herodes</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Son of <em>Odænathus</em> by a former Wife, should
succeed his Father in prejudice to her Children,
and for that reason was consenting to
his Murther (as <em>Pollio</em> intimates in <em>Herodes</em> and
<em>Mæonius</em>,) much less would she endure the
Title of <em>Augustus</em> in the Son of <em>Herodes</em>, especially
when her own Sons were, as 'tis probable,
elder than such Grandson. So that
'tis most likely that <em>Herennianus</em> and <em>Timolaus</em>,
whom <em>Pollio</em> reckons among his XXX Tyrants,
might be the Younger Sons of <em>Zenobia</em>,
on whom also, out of Motherly Affection,
she might bestow the same Titles of
Honour.</p>

<p>But it must be observed, that in the Greek
Coins, this Prince's Name is usually written
ΑΥΤ. ΕΡΜΙΑΣ ΟΥΑΒΑΛΛΑΘΟΣ ΑΘΗΝΟΥ (as
<em>Tristan</em> says he found it upon several Medals,)
but <em>Patin</em> has the last Word only ΑΘΗ. I
should be glad to peruse some of these curious
Coins, especially if found in or near <em>Palmyra</em>:
but I am inclinable to believe that his
true Name was <em>Æranes Waballathus</em> (as was
one of his Progenitors, in Inscription <em>Pag.</em>
91.) though perhaps the remoter Cities of
<em>Asia</em> and <em>Ionia</em> might by mistake write it
<em>Hermias</em>. And 'tis probable that ΑΘΗΝ might
be for the first Letters of the Name of
ΟΔΗΝΑΘΟΣ, which in Syriack begun with
an <em>Aleph</em>; and the Δ was with those People
used instead of Θ, as we see the Month <em>Xanthicus</em>,
written Ξανδικὸς in many of these Inscriptions,
which doubtless was pronounced
like D <em>blæsum</em> or the Saxon D.</p>

<p>Though this City were at that time so
roughly treated by <em>Aurelian</em>, yet it is certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
that he did not burn it, or destroy the Buildings
thereof: And though <em>Zosimus</em>, on this
occasion, uses the Words τὴν πόλιν κατασκάψας,
yet that seems only to relate to his demolishing
the Walls and Defences of the Place;
and that Emperors own Letter extant in
<em>Vopiscus</em>, doth sufficiently shew that he spared
the City it self, and that he took care
to re-instate the beautiful Temple of the
<em>Sun</em> that was there, which had been Plundered
by his Soldiers. However, the Damage
then sustained was never retrieved by
the Inhabitants, and I do not find that ever
this City made any figure in History after it:
Yet the <em>Latin Inscription</em>, (Pag. 106.) seems
to intimate, as if <em>Dioclesian</em> had restored
their Walls within thirty Years after. About
the Year of Christ 400, it was the Head
Quarters of the <em>Legio Prima Illyricorum</em>; and
though <em>Stephanus</em> gives it no better Title
than φρούριον, yet it appears to have been an
Archbishop's See, under the Metropolitan
of <em>Damascus</em>. To say in what Age, or from
what Hand it received its final Overthrow,
which reduced it to the miserable Condition
it now appears in, there is no light in
any of our Historians; but it is probable it
perish'd long since, in the obscure Ages of
the World, during the Wars of the <em>Saracen</em>
Empire; and being burnt and desolated, it
was never rebuilt; which occasions the Ruins
to lie so entire, in a manner as they were
left, neither being used to other Structures
on the Place, nor worth carrying away, because
of the great distance thereof from any
other City.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the Geographical Site of <em>Palmyra</em>,
<em>Ptolemy</em> places it in the Latitude of <em>Tripoly</em> on
the Coast of <em>Syria</em>, and four Degrees more
Easterly, <em>viz.</em></p>

<p class="center">Παλμύρα. οα, ϛ′. λδ.
</p>

<p>and he makes it the Capital of sixteen Cities
in <em>Syria Palmyrena</em>, whereof <em>Alalis</em>, <em>Danaba</em> and
<em>Evaria</em> were afterwards <em>Bishops Sees</em>. <em>Pliny</em>
places it CCIII Miles from the nearest Coast
of <em>Syria</em>, and CCCXXXVII from <em>Seleucia ad
Tygrim</em> near <em>Bagdat</em>, (which Numbers are
erroneously Printed 252 and 537 in most Editions,
contrary to the Authority of the
MSS.) <em>Josephus</em> places it one Days Journey
from <em>Euphrates</em>, and six from <em>Babylon</em>; which
must be understood of Horse-man's Journeys
of about sixty Miles <em>per diem</em>, it being more
than so much from this City to <em>Euphrates</em>.
<em>Ptolemy</em> also mentions a River running by
<em>Palmyra</em>, which did not appear to our Travellers,
unless that Gut or Channel wherein
they were overflowed by the Rain-Waters,
were the Bed thereof; which may, possibly,
run with a constant Stream in the Winter
or times of much Rain: But this (as the
Rivers of <em>Aleppo</em> and <em>Damascus</em> at this Day)
is made by <em>Ptolomy</em> to have no <em>exit</em>; but to
go off in <em>Vapour</em>, and to be imbibed by the
thirsty Earth of these Desarts.</p>

<p>The <em>Æra</em> or Accompt of Years observed
by the <em>Palmyreni</em> in these Inscriptions, is evidently
that of <em>Seleucus</em>, call'd afterwards
<em>Dhilcarnian</em> or <em>Bicornis</em> by the <em>Arabians</em>, and
by them kept in use till above 900 Years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Christ (as appears by the Observations of
<em>Albatani</em>, published in <em>Numb.</em> 204 of the <em>Philosoph.
Transact.</em>) and not that of the Death
of <em>Alexander</em>. This may be demonstrated
from the Inscription (<em>Pag. 101.</em>) wherein
<em>Alexander Severus</em> is stiled ΘΕΟΣ; that is,
after the Death and Consecration of that Emperor,
or after the Year of our Lord 234;
and from the Name of <em>Julius</em>, who, when
this Inscription was put up, was <em>Præfectus
Prætorio</em>, (and could be no other than <em>Julius
Philippus Arabs</em> who might be esteemed by
the <em>Palmyreni</em> as their Country-man,) it follows,
that it was in the last Year of <em>Gordian</em>
<em>Anno Christi</em> 242 or 243: And that Emperor
being soon after Murder'd by the Treachery
of this <em>Philip</em>, who succeeded him: And his
Treason coming afterwards to light, 'tis not
strange that his Name was purposely effaced
in this Inscription. The Date thereof, <em>Anno</em>
554, shews the beginning of this Accompt
311 or 312 Years before Christ, co-incident
with the <em>Æra</em> of <em>Seleucus</em>, which was likewise
observed by several other Cities in the
East.</p>

<p>I shall not undertake the part of a Critick
on these Inscriptions, but chuse rather to
leave them to the more professedly skilful in
that part of Learning, and shall only make
some few Remarks on them, such as occurred
whilst they pass'd through my Hands.</p>

<p>1. That the more ancient of these Inscriptions
dated before the Year 500, do no
where make use of <em>Roman Prænomina</em>, which
yet are very frequent in them that follow;
particularly <em>Julius</em>, <em>Aurelius</em> and <em>Septimius</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
taken up by these People out of Respect to
the Emperors that bore those Names; and
consequently that <em>Septimius Odænathus</em> (the
Inscription of whose Tomb we have, <em>pag. 91.</em>)
was most probably the same who was afterwards
<em>Augustus</em>. That Name growing in
use in the Reign of <em>Septimius Severus</em>, under
whom or his Son <em>Caracalla</em> this <em>Odænathus</em>
was certainly Born. And this Monument
being erected by him whilst he was yet a private
Man; and he afterwards attaining the
Imperial Dignity, it was necessary the Inscription
of his Tomb (which perhaps was
that single one that was all of Marble) should
be changed: Upon which occasion this Stone
might be brought back into the Town, and
after its Destruction, be clapt up casually
over the little Gate-way where now it
stands.</p>

<p>2. <em>Pag. 100.</em> ΚΑΤΕΛΘΟΝΤΕΣ ΕΙΣ ΟΛΟΓΕΣΙΑΔΑ
ΕΝΠΟΡΟΙΑΝ ΕΣΤΗΣΑΝ: <em>Descendentes
Vologesiada Commercium stabiliverunt, Anno</em>
558, <em>sive Anno Christi</em> 247. Whereby it appears,
that this People having had their
Trade interrupted by the Wars between the
<em>Romans</em> and the <em>Persians</em>, under <em>Gordian</em>; did
now send an Embassy to the Court of <em>Sapores</em>
King of the <em>Persians</em>, to get it re-established;
which succeeded according to their Desires.
<em>Vologesias</em> was a City built by <em>Vologeses</em> King
of the <em>Parthians</em> in the time of <em>Nero</em>, on the
<em>Euphrates</em> below <em>Babylon</em>. <em>Ptolemy</em> calls it
Οὐολογεσιάς; <em>Stephanus</em>, Βολογεσιὰς; <em>Ammianus</em>
<em>Vologessia</em>; and <em>Pliny</em> lib. 6. <em>Vologesocirta</em>.</p>

<p>3. <em>Pag. 101.</em> ΚΑΙ ΟΥΚΟΝΙΣΩΝΑ ΦΕΙΔΗΣΑΝΤΑ
ΧΡΗΜΑΤΩΝ. I submit it to the Judgment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
the Criticks, whether this faulty Place may
not be amended by reading it ΟΥΚ ΟΙΚΕΙΩΝ
ΑΦΕΙΔΗΣΑΝΤΑ, <em>&amp;c.</em> as likewise whether
ΔΙΣΜΑΛΚΟΥ in the same Inscription may not
be instead of ΜΑΛΛΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΜΑΛΚΟΥ, which is
the Ingenious Conjecture of that excellent
Grammarian Mr. <em>William Baxter</em>.</p>

<p>4. <em>Pag. 102.</em> <em>Septimium Vorodem Procuratorem
Ducenarium Augusti &amp;</em> ΑΡΟΑΠΕΤΗΝ. This
Word, if <em>Greek</em>, is faultily transcribed; and
in one Copy I have seen, the Ο is very small,
as I suppose it on the Stone, which might
occasion the transcribing thereof without it
in the former Voyage (<em>Pag. 130.</em>) So that
'tis most probable that 'tis the remains of
some other Letter almost worn out. I conjecture
it to have been ΑΡΤΑΓΕΤΗΝ, Π being
taken for Γ, and that this <em>Septimius</em> was <em>Præfectus
Annonæ</em>, having the Care to see that
the City were sufficiently provided with
Bread; which was a most necessary Officer
in a Place that must needs be furnish'd with
Corn from Abroad. And this same <em>Septimius</em>,
(in the Inscription, <em>Pag. 105.</em>) is stiled
.... ΕΟΔΟΤΗΝ ΤΗΣ ΜΗΤΡΟΚΟΛΩΝΕΙΑΣ.
<em>lege</em> ΚΡΕΟΔΟΤΗΝ, which should signifie that
he was the Distributor of the Emperor's Munificence
in Flesh to the People. These Inscriptions
bear Date in <em>April</em>, <em>Anno Dom.</em> 267.
not long before the Death of <em>Odænathus</em>, who
is herein stiled ΣΕΒΑΣΤΟΣ: and 'tis not improbable
but he might institute such a Custom,
as at the Publick Charge, to give the
People a Largess in Flesh on particular Days,
to reconcile them to the Dominion of their
Fellow-Citizen. This is certain, that <em>Au<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>relian</em>
first instituted such a Custom of giving
Flesh at <em>Rome</em>: The Words of <em>Vopiscus</em> are,
<em>Idem Aurelianus &amp; porcinam carnem populo Romano
distribuit, quæ hodieque dividitur</em>; which
Custom continued till the time of <em>Constantine</em>,
when (according to <em>Zosimus</em>) one <em>Lucian</em>,
who had this Office of distributing Swines
Flesh at <em>Rome</em>, had Interest enough among
the People to set up <em>Maxentius</em> for Emperor;
and <em>Salmasius</em> assures us, that it was not discontinued
till the time of <em>Heraclius</em>. It will
not therefore seem strange, if I suppose <em>Aurelian</em>
might find that Custom at <em>Palmyra</em>, and
at his return from thence institute the like at
<em>Rome</em>.</p>

<p>I am inclined to believe, that not only
those two Inscriptions, <em>Pag. 102</em>, and the
last of <em>Pag. 103</em>, but also that of <em>Pag. 106</em>,
were in Honour of the same <em>Septimius Vorodes</em>
who seems to have been a great Favourite of
<em>Odænathus</em>, and was without doubt respected
by the <em>Romans</em> on that account, whom I conclude
to have effaced all the Memorials of
<em>Zenobia</em> and <em>Waballathus</em>, insomuch that no
one appears, among those many taken, that
was set up during the six Years they reigned.
The Name <em>Vorodes</em> seems the same with
<em>Orodes</em>, which was the Name of the King of
the <em>Parthians</em> that slew <em>Crassus</em>: and the <em>Persians</em>
having, about forty Years before, expelled
the Race of the <em>Arsacidæ</em>, 'tis not improbable
but the Remains of that Royal
Family might fly for Succour to <em>Palmyra</em>,
and this <em>Vorodes</em> might be one of them.</p>

<p>5. In two other Copies of these Inscriptions;
the first of <em>pag. 104.</em> is read, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>Σεπτίμιον
Αἰράνην Ὀδαινάθου, and not Ὀδαινόθου as in the
first Copy, and perhaps ought rather to be
Ὀδαίναθον, as being the Inscription under a
Statue of the same <em>Odænathus</em>, who is here,
as well as on his Tomb, stiled <em>Illustrissimus
Patricius</em>, but without a Date.</p>

<p>6. ΥΠΟ ΙΑΡΙΒΩΛΟΥ ΘΕΟΥ (<em>pag. 101.</em> &amp; 109.)
It cannot well be doubted but that this <em>Deus
Jaribolus</em> is the same with what <em>Gruter</em> (<em>pag.</em>
86.) and <em>Spon</em> (in the first of his Inscriptions)
reads ΑΓΛΙΒΩΛΩ. By the Figure of the
Idol extant in <em>Spon</em>, it appears that this God
was made with the Moon upon his Shoulders,
and consequently was the <em>Deus Lunus</em> worshipped
by the <em>Syrians</em>, whose Name, in the
Language of that Country, could not be
better expressed than by <em>Jarehbol</em> ירה ביעל
<em>Dominus Lunus</em>. Whence I am induced to
believe, that <em>Gruter</em> mistook it ΑΓΛΙΒΩΛΩ for
ΑΓΑΙΒΩΛΩ, the Ι in the beginning, and the
lower part of the round stroke of the Ρ, being
effaced, so as to pass for Γ. I have taken
care to have the Stone purposely viewed, as
also to get from thence the exact Figure of
the <em>Syrian</em> or <em>Palmyrene</em> Characters thereon,
wherein there is an irreconcilable difference
between <em>Spon</em> and <em>Gruter</em>. By the help of
these, compared with two others taken at
<em>Palmyra</em>, which I have by me, (they being
all very near the same Date,) I hope we may
be able, one Day, to make out the <em>Palmyrene</em>
Alphabet: But it were to be wish'd our Travellers
had transcribed them with more Curiosity,
and taken more of them.</p>

<p>By the way, it is remarkable, that the Person
who dedicated this Monument, in <em>Gruter</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
and <em>Spon</em>, is stiled Λ. ΑΥΡ. ΗΛΙΟΔΩΡΟΣ: and
the same Name occurs in a broken Inscription
which Mr. <em>Hallifax</em> omitted in his Letter
to Dr. <em>Bernard</em>, as being too imperfect.
It stood on the right Hand of the entrance
to the little Temple described <em>pag. 110.</em> and
was thus,</p>

<p>ΛΟΥΚΙΟΥ ΑΥΡΗ[ΛΙ]ΟΥ ..... ΗΛΙΟΔΩΡΟΥ ΤΟΥ.</p>

<p>And after a Blank of three lines all worn out
except one single Ο, there followed,</p>

<p>[ΤΕΙ]ΜΗΣ ΧΑΡΙΝ ΕΤΟΥΣ....... ΜΗΝΟΣ
[ΑΠ]ΕΛΛΑΙ[ΟΥ]. And that imperfect one in
<em>pag. 104.</em> seems to have relation to the same
Name.</p>

<p>7. <em>Pag. 111.</em> ΜΑΛΕΝΤΟΝ ΚΑΙ ΑΓΡΙΠΠΑΝ
<em>lege</em> ΜΑΛΗΝ ΤΟΝ ΚΑΙ ΑΓΡΙΠΠΑΝ, it being written
ΜΑΛΗΝΤΟΝ, with Η in the two other
Copies I have seen, whereby the Sence is
cleared.</p>

<p>8. <em>Pag. 117.</em> ΑΓΑΘΑΝΓΕΛΟΣ ΑΒΙΛΗΝΟΣ ΤΗΣ
ΔΕΚΑΠΟΛΕΟΣ, <em>Agathangelus Abilenus, Decapolitanus,
Patronymice</em>. There were in these
Parts two Cities known by the Name of <em>Abila</em>;
to distinguish which, the one was called <em>Abila
Lysaniæ</em>, from the Name of the Tetrarch:
St. <em>Luke</em>, ch. 3. 1. and is placed by <em>Ptolemy</em>
(in his <em>Cælosyria</em>) about mid-way between
<em>Damascus</em> and <em>Heliopolis</em>: The other in <em>Judæa</em>,
called <em>Abila ad Jordanem</em>, described by <em>Josephus</em>
in many Places, to lie over-against <em>Jericho</em>,
near the <em>Dead-Sea</em>. <em>Decapolis</em> was so
called from its Ten Cities, enumerated by
<em>Pliny</em> (<em>lib.</em> 5. 18.) And with them he reckons
up, among others, the <em>Tetrarchy</em> of <em>Abila</em>, in
the same <em>Decapolis</em>: Which demonstrates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
<em>Abila Decapolis</em> and <em>Abila Lysaniæ</em> to be the
same Place. And tho' it cannot be denied,
but that some of <em>Pliny</em>'s Ten Cities are not
far distant from that near <em>Jordan</em>; yet it doth
not appear that ever this other had the Title
of a <em>Tetrarchy</em>. Here it is to be observed,
that what <em>Pliny</em> calls <em>Decapolis</em>, <em>Ptolemy</em> makes
his <em>Cæle Syria</em>; and the <em>Cæle Syria</em> of <em>Pliny</em>, is
that part of <em>Syria</em> about <em>Aleppo</em>, formerly call'd
<em>Chalcidene</em>, <em>Cyrrhistice</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>What this Town of <em>Teibe</em> was anciently
call'd, is not so easily conjectured: But if the
Numbers of <em>Ptolemy</em> may be confided in, it
is very near the Situation of a City he calls
<em>Oriza</em>; and perhaps his <em>Adada</em> may be our
<em>Soukney</em>, and his <em>Rhæsapha</em> what is now called
<em>Arsoffa</em>.</p>

<p>It is taken for granted, that Old <em>Aleppo</em>
was anciently the City of <em>Berrhæa</em>, and there
wants not ancient Testimony to prove it;
which being granted, I think I may without
scruple conclude, that <em>Andrene</em> (<em>pag. 122.</em> and
133.) is the Ruins of the City of <em>Androna</em>;
and <em>Esree</em> (<em>pag. 135.</em>) that of <em>Seriane</em>, both
mentioned in the Itinerary of <em>Antoninus</em>, in
the Journey <em>à Dolicâ Seriane</em>. But this whole
Country is laid about half a Degree more
Southerly than it ought, by <em>Ptolemy</em>, who
places <em>Berrhæa</em> in Lat. 36 <em>deg.</em> For the Meridian
Altitude of the Tropical Sun at <em>Aleppo</em>
is found there but 77 <em>deg.</em> whence the Latitude
36 <em>deg.</em> 30 <em>min.</em> as it was observed, <em>Anno</em>
1680. by three several Quadrants, in the presence
of a curious Gentleman, to whom I am
obliged for this Communication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>By the same Observation a much greater
Error is amended in the Latitude of <em>Aleppo</em>,
in the <em>Rudolfine</em> Tables of <em>Kepler</em>, who supposes
<em>Aleppo</em> to have been the ancient <em>Antiochia
ad Taurum</em>, and accordingly places it Lat. 37.
<em>deg.</em> 20 <em>min.</em> wherein he is followed by <em>Bullialdus</em>
and others; and several Maps have copied
the Mistake. But a much greater use
of it is, that thereby we are assured, that
the City of <em>Aracta</em>, wherein <em>Albatani</em> made
the Observations we have Publish'd in the
<em>Philosoph. Transact. Numb.</em> 204. was, without
doubt, the same which is now called <em>Racca</em> on
the <em>Euphrates</em>; of which Town an Account
may be seen in <em>Rauwolf</em>'s Voyages, and which
was not many Miles below the Place where
our Travellers first came on the River: And
if <em>Arecca</em>, in the Language of this Country,
relates to Victory (as is said in <em>pag. 143.</em>) it
was, doubtless, anciently the City <em>Nicephorion</em>,
built by <em>Alexander</em> the Great; with which the
Situation exactly agrees. The Latitude thereof
was observed by that <em>Albatani</em> with great
accurateness, about eight hundred Years since;
and therefore I recommended it to all that are
curious of such Matters, to endeavour to get
some good Observation made at this Place, to
determine the Height of the Pole there, thereby
to decide the Controversie, whether there
hath really been any Change in the Axis of
the Earth, in so long an Interval; which
some great Authors of late, have been willing
to suppose. And if any curious Traveller,
or Merchant residing there, would please to
observe, with due care, the Phases of the
Moons Eclipses at <em>Bagdat</em>, <em>Aleppo</em> and <em>Alexan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>dria</em>,
thereby to determin their Longitudes,
they could not do the Science of Astronomy a
greater Service: For in and near these Places
were made all the Observations whereby the
middle Motions of the Sun and Moon are limited:
And I could then pronounce in what
Proportion the Moon's Motion does Accelerate;
which that it does, I think I can demonstrate,
and shall (God willing) one Day,
make it appear to the Publick.</p>

<p>The <em>Philosophical Reader</em> is desired to excuse
our breaking in upon the Subject of these

Matters, as also our exceeding the

of the Subject, joyned to the Desires of
the <em>Royal Society</em>, may make an easie Apology
suffice. There may be many other Instructive
Remarks made thereon, which still deserve
the Consideration of the Learned, and from
such the Publick may yet expect a further Account.</p>

<h2><em>A Voyage of the Emperour of <strong>China</strong>
into the Eastern <strong>Tartary</strong>,
Anno. 1682.</em></h2>


<p>The Emperour of <em>China</em> made a Voyage into
Eastern <em>Tartary</em>, in the beginning of
this Year 1682, after having appeased (by the
Death of three Rebellious Kings) a Revolt,
formed in some Provinces of the Empire: One
of those revolted Princes, was Strangled in
the Province, of which he had made himself
Master: The second being brought to <em>Pekin</em>
with the Principal Heads of his Faction, was
cut in Pieces in the sight of the whole Court:
The most Considerable among the <em>Mandarines</em>,
acting with their own hands in this sad Execution,
to Revenge upon this Rebel the
Death of their Parents, which he had caused
to be Cruelly Murdered.</p>

<p>The third which was the most Considerable,
(and indeed the Chief of all the Revolt)
had by a voluntary Death prevented his deserved
Punishment, and so put an end to a
War, which had lasted for Seven Years.</p>

<p>The Peace having been settled, by the Re-establishing
in the Empire and all the Provinces,
the Peaceable Enjoyment of their
Ancient Liberties: The Emperour departed
the 23<em>d.</em> of <em>March</em> to go into the Province
of <em>Leao-tum</em>, the Country of his Ancestors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
with a Design of visiting their Sepulchers,
and (after having honoured them with the
usual Ceremonies) of prosecuting his Journey
into the Eastern <em>Tartary</em>: This Journey was
was about 1100 <em>miles</em>, from <em>Pekin</em> to the end
of it.</p>

<p>The Emperour took with him his eldest
Son, a young Prince of ten years old, which
had already been declared Heir of the Empire:
The three principal Queens went also
in this Journy, each in their gilded Chariot;
the principal Kings also which compose this
Empire, were accompanying with all the
Grandees of the Court: And the most considerable
<em>Mandarines</em> of all the Orders, who
having all a very great Train of Attendants,
and very numerous Equipage, made a Court
about the Emperour of more then 70000 Persons.</p>

<p>It was his Will that I should accompany
him in this Journey, and that I should be always
near him, to the end I might make in
his Presence, the Observations, necessary for
knowing the disposition of the Heavens, the
elevation of the Pole, the Magnetical Declinations
of every Place, and for Measuring
with Mathematical Instruments the height
of the Mountains, and the distances of Places:
He was well pleased also to be informed
of what concerned Meteors, and many
other Physical and Mathematical Matters.</p>

<p>In so much, that he gave Order to an Officer
to carry upon Horses such Instruments
as I should have occasion to make use of, and
recommended me to the Prince his Unkle,
who is also his Father in Law, and the se<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>cond
Person of the State, he is called by a
<em>Chinese</em> Name, which signifies an Associate
of the Empire: He gave charge to him to
cause all things to be provided for me which
were necessary for this Journey, which this
Prince performed with a very particular goodness,
causing me to Lodge always in his
own Tent, and to eat at his Table.</p>

<p>The Emperour ordered that they should
give me Horses of his own Stables, to the
End I might the more easily Change in Riding,
and some of those were of them He
Himself had Rid, which is a Mark of very
extraordinary distinction. In this Journey
we always went toward the North-east:
From <em>Pekin</em> to the Province of <em>Leao-tum</em>,
the Way being about 300 Miles is pretty
equal: In the Province it self of <em>Leao-tum</em>,
it is about 400 Miles, but much more unequal
by Reason of the Mountains; from the
Frontier of this Province to the City of <em>La</em>,
or the River which the <em>Tartars</em> call <em>Songoro</em>,
and the <em>Chinoise</em> <em>Sumhoa</em>, the way (which is about
400 Miles) is very difficult, being crossed
sometimes by Mountains extreamly
Steep, sometimes by Valleys of extraordinary
Depth, and through Desert Plains, wherein
for two or three Days March we met with
nothing. The Mountains of this Country
are Covered on the East side with great Oaks
and old Forrests, which have not been cut
for some Ages.</p>

<p>All the Country which is beyond the Province
of <em>Leao-tum</em> is exceeding Desert where
nothing is to be seen on all sides but Mountains
and Valleys, and Dens of <em>Bears</em>, <em>Tigers</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
and other <em>Devouring</em> Beasts, you can scarce
find a House, but only some <em>poor Reed Huts</em>,
upon the sides of some Brooks and Streams.
All the Cities and <em>Burrow-towns</em> which I have
seen in the Province of <em>Leao-tum</em>, and which
are in very great Numbers are intirely ruined:
One can see nothing thro' the whole Country,
but old ruined Walls with Rubble, Bricks and
Stones. In the out-skirts of these Cities there
have been of late some few Houses built, but
without any order. Some of them made of
Earth, others of the Rubbish of the old Buildings,
the most part of them covered with Straw
or Thatch, and but few with Tiles. There is
now not the least Footsteps remaining of a
great number of Towns and Villages which
were here before the War. Because the petty
King of the <em>Tartars</em>, who began to kindle
this War having but a very small Army,
caused the Inhabitants of those Places to take
Arms, which Places he forthwith destroyed,
that he might take from his Soldiers the hopes
of ever returning again to their own <em>Homes</em>.</p>

<p>The Capital City of <em>Leao-tum</em>, which is
called <em>Xyn-Yam</em>, is a City very fair and pretty
intire, it has as yet the Remains of an
Antient <em>Palace</em>. It is (for as much as I was
able to remark by divers Observations) of
the Latitude of 41 <em>degrees</em> 56 <em>minutes</em>; that is
to say, two <em>degrees</em> above <em>Pekin</em>, tho' hitherto
both the <em>Europeans</em> and the <em>Chinese</em> have
given that City the Latitude of 41 <em>degrees</em>.
There is in that City no declination of the
Magnetick Needle, as I have found by many
reiterated Observations. The City of <em>Ula</em>
which was almost the very Extream of our Jour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>ney,
lies in 44 <em>degrees</em> and 20 <em>minutes</em>. The compass
there declines from the South to the
West one <em>degree</em> 40 <em>minutes</em>.</p>

<p>But to resume the Prosecution of our Journey,
from <em>Pekin</em> to this Extream towards the
East there is made a new Way, by which the
Emperour can commodiously March with his
Horse, and the Queens in their Chariots.
This Way is about 10 <em>foot</em> broad, and as even
and streight as could possibly be made;
it is extended above 1000 <em>Miles</em>, it has a little
Raising on each side of about a Foot high
every where equal and perfectly Parallel to
one another; and this Way was as neat,
especially when the Weather was fair, as a
Floor where the Husbandmen beat out their
Corn in the Field; there were also certain
Persons along this way, who only took care
to Smooth and Cleanse it. The Christians
have no where so great care of Sweeping their
Streets and publick Places where the Holy
Sacrament is to pass in the Processions, as
these Infidels have of cleansing the Ways,
where their Kings and their Queens are to
pass, every time they go out of their Palaces.</p>

<p>There was made for their Return a way
like the former, they plained or levelled the
Mountains as far as they were able, they
raised Bridges over the Rivers, and for ornamenting
them, they had extended on each side
of them a sort of Mats upon which they had
Painted divers Figures of Animals, which had
the same effect with Tapestry Hangings, with
which the Streets are usually hung in Procession.</p>

<p>The Emperor did very seldom make use
of this Way, being almost always in Hunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>ing:
And when he accompanied the Queens
he only Rode by the side of it, to the End
that the great number of Horse which were
in the Train that followed should not spoil
it: He ordinarily Marched at the Head of
this kind of Army. The Queens followed
immediately in their Chariots, with their
Train and their Equipage; they notwithstanding
left some space between the King and
themselves: After these Marched the Kings,
the Grandees of the Court and the <em>Mandarines</em>,
every one according to his Rank, behind
these an infinity of Attendants, and other
People on Horse-back brought up the
Rear-guard.</p>

<p>As there was not one City upon all this
Way, that could either Lodge so great a
Multitude, or Furnish them with Provisions,
and that the greatest Part of their Journey
was through a Country very little Inhabited,
so they were Necessitated to carry along with
them all things that were Necessary for the
journey, and even Provisions of Victuals for
three Months.</p>

<p>Upon this Account there were sent before
by the Ways which were made on each side
of the Emperors Way, an Infinity of Waggons,
Cammels, Horses, and Mules for to
carry the Baggage: Besides these the Emperor,
the Kings and almost all the Grandees
of the Court, had great numbers of Horses
led, for the use of changing from time to time.
I do not here reckon the Droves of Beefs,
Sheep, and other Cattel, which they were obliged
to have with them. And though this
great Multitude of Men, Horses, and Droves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
passed by a way at a good distance from that
of the Emperor, yet it raised so horrible a
Dust, that we always seemed to March in
a cloud, and thence found it Difficult to distinguish
those that Marched 15 or 20 Paces
from us.</p>

<p>The March was so well regulated, that
this Army Incamped every Night upon the
sides of some River or Brook. 'Twas for
this Reason that they caused the Tents and
the Baggage necessary for this Incamping to
set out very early in the Morning; and the
Quarter-masters upon their first arrival,
Marked the Ground most proper for the placing
of the Emperors Tent, of the Queens,
of the Kings, of the Grandees, of the Court,
of the <em>Mandarines</em>, each according to his Dignity,
and according to the Dignity he had
in the <em>Chinese</em> Militia, which is divided into
eight Orders or into eight Standards.</p>

<p>In the space of three Months we passed about
1000 <em>Miles</em>, advancing towards the North-east,
and about as many in our return: In
fine, we arrived at <em>Kam-Hay</em>, which is a Fort
situated between the South Sea and the Mountains
of the North: It is there where is the
beginning of that so much Celebrated Wall,
and which separates the Province of <em>Leao-tum</em>
from that of <em>Pekely</em>; from whence it is extended
very far on the side of the North over the
tops of the highest Mountains. When we entred
this Province, the Emperor, the Kings,
and the Grandees of the Court, quitted the
great Way of which we have hitherto spoken,
to take that of the Mountains of the North,
which are extended without Interruption to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>wards
the North-East: There some Days
were passed in Hunting, which was performed
in this manner.</p>

<p>The Emperor chose 3000 Men of his Life-guard,
Armed with Arrows and Javelins,
and dispersed them some on this side some on
that; so that they possest themselves of a
great Circuit about the Mountains, which
they Environed on all Parts, which made a kind
of Circle whose Diameter was at least 3000 <em>Paces</em>;
then Marching to draw nearer together
with equal Progress and without quitting their
Range, what ever Obstacles they found in
the way (the Emperor having joyned with
them several of the Captains, and of the
Grandees of the Court, for the better keeping
of their Order) they Reduced this great
Circle to another much less, which had about
300 <em>Paces</em> in the Diameter: So that all
the Beasts which had been stayed within the
first, found themselves taken in this last as in
a Net: for that every one setting his Feet
upon the Ground, they Locked themselves together
so closely, that they left no meshing
Place for them to make their Escape by. Then
they Pursued them so Vigorously in this little
Space, that the poor Creatures tired with the
violence of their Coursing, came and fell
down at the Feet of their Chasers, and suffered
themselves to be taken without trouble.
I saw taken in this Manner two or three
Hundred Hares in less then one day, without
counting an Infinite of Wolves and Foxes.
I have seen the same thing divers times done
in that part of <em>Tartary</em>, which is on the other
side of the Province of <em>Leao-tum</em>, where I re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>member
to have seen, among others, more
than 1000 Deer so pent up by these sort of Nets,
which came to cast themselves into the Hands
of the Hunters, having found no passage to
save themselves by: they kill'd also Bears,
Boars, and more than 60 Tigers, but these
are taken by other means, and with other
Weapons.</p>

<p>The Emperor will'd that I should be present
at all these different Huntings, and he recommended
to his Father in Law, in a most obliging
Manner the having a particular care
of me, and of giving charge that I should not
be exposed to any danger in the Hunting of
the Tigers, and the other fierce Beasts; I was
the only Person of all the <em>Mandarines</em> who was
without Arms, and so near to the Emperor;
though I made Light of the Fatigue during
the time we were in our Journey, I found my
self so wearied every Evening when I got
to my Tent, that I was not able to support
my Self; and I should have dispensed
with my self divers times from following the
Emperor, if my Friends had not counsel'd
me to the contrary, and if I had not fear'd
that he would have taken it ill if he should
have perceived it.</p>

<p>After having passed about 400 Miles in
Hunting daily after this manner, we arrived
at last at <em>Xyn-Yam</em>, the Capital City of the
Province, where we stayed four Days.</p>

<p>The Inhabitants of <em>Coree</em> came to present to
the Emperor a <em>Sea-Calf</em> which they had taken,
the Emperor caused me to see it, and asked
whither our <em>European</em> Books had spoken any
thing of this Fish? I told him we had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Book in our Library at <em>Pekin</em> which had explain'd
the Nature of it, and dispatched presently
a Courrier to our Fathers at <em>Pekin</em>, who
brought it me in a few Days: The Emperor
was pleased to see that what was said of this
Fish in this Book, was agreeable to this which
he had seen, and caused it to be carried back
again to <em>Pekin</em> to be carefully preserved.</p>

<p>During the stay which we made in this City,
the Emperor with the Queens went to visit
the Sepulchers of his Ancestors, which
are not very far distant, from whence he sent
them back to <em>Xyn-Yam</em>, to continue his own
Journey into the Eastern <em>Tartary</em>.</p>

<p>After several Days of Marching and Hunting,
he arrived at <em>Kirin</em>, which is distant
from <em>Xyn-Yam</em> 400 Miles: This City is built
along the great River <em>Songoro</em> which takes its
source from the Mountain <em>Cham-pe</em>, distant
400 Miles towards the South: This Mountain
so Famous in the East for having been
the Antient Seat of our <em>Tartars</em>, is always
covered with Snow, from whence it had its
Name, because <em>Cham-pe</em> signifies the white
Mountain.</p>

<p>So soon as the Emperor saw it, he alighted
from his Horse and fell on his Knees on
the Bank of the River, and bowed Himself
three times to the Ground to Salute it: After
which, he caused himself to be carried upon
a glorious Throne of Gold, and so made
his Entry into the City: All the People ran
in a throng before him, testifying by their
Acclamations the Joy they had to see him.
This Prince took great Pleasure in those Testimonies
of their Affection; and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
might give them some Marks of his being very
sensible of it, he was pleased to suffer himself
to be seen by all, and forbid his Guards
to hinder the People from approaching him,
as they used to do at <em>Pekin</em>.</p>

<p>They make in this City Barks of a very
particular manner: The Inhabitants keep always
a great number of them ready fitted to
Repulse the <em>Muscovites</em>, who come often into
this River, to dispute the Fishing of Pearls.
The Emperor reposed himself two Days, after
which he Descended upon the River with
some Lords, accompanied with more than 100
Boats, till he arrived at the City of <em>Ula</em>,
which is the fairest of all this Country, and
which at other times hath been the Seat of
the Empire of the <em>Tartars</em>.</p>

<p>A little below this City, which is at most
about 32 <em>Miles</em> from <em>Kirin</em>, the River is very
full of a certain Fish which resemble near enough
the Plaice of <em>Europe</em>: and 'twas principally
for the taking the Divertisement of
Fishing, that the Emperor went to <em>Ula</em>; but
the Rains coming on so suddainly, swelled
the River so much, that all their Nets were
broken and carried away, by the great Flood
of those Land Waters: The Emperor notwithstanding
stayed 5 or 6 Days at <em>Ula</em>; but seeing
the Rains were not at all discontinued, he
was obliged to come back to <em>Kirin</em>, without
having enjoyed the Pleasure of Fishing: as we
ascended the River, the Bark wherein I was
with the Emperors Father in Law, was so
indamaged by the agitation of the Waves,
that we were constrained to go a Shore, and
mount a Chariot drawn by one Ox, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
carried us very slowly to <em>Kirin</em>, the Rains
not at all ceasing during our Journy.</p>

<p>In the Evening when the Emperor was entertained
upon all these Adventures, he said
Laughing, <em>the Fish have cheated us</em>; at length,
after we had stayed two Days at <em>Kirin</em>, the
Rains began to diminish, and we retook our
Way towards <em>Leao-tum</em>. I cannot here express
the Pains and Fatigues these had caused
us to undergo, during the whole Course of
this Journy, by Reason of the Ways which
the Rains had Spoiled, and rendred almost
impassable: we went without staying over the
Mountains and over the Vallies, and we could
not pass but with extream Danger, the Brooks
and Rivers which were swelled by the Floods
and Inundations which ran from all Parts: the
Bridges were either overturned by the Violence
of the Currents, or all covered by the
great overflowing of the Waters. There were
made in divers Places great Collections of
Water, and of Mud, that it was almost impossible
to be drawn out of it. The Horses,
Cammels, and other Beasts of Burthen, which
carried the Baggage could not advance, but
remained sticking in the Mud of the Marshes,
or died of tiring upon the Ways. The Men
were not at all less incommoded, and all were
enfeebled for want of Victuals, and of Refreshments
necessary for so great a Journy:
Many of the Horsemen were obliged, either
to lead their Horses on Foot, who were no
longer able to carry them, or to rest in the
middle of the Fields to suffer them to take
Breath: And though the Quarter-masters and
the Harbingers, spared not their Pains, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
for Wood (which they cut on all sides) to fill
with Faggots all the bad Passages: Yet notwithstanding
after the Horses and Chariots,
which took the Van early in the Morning
had quite passed, it was impossible to pass after
them: The Emperor himself, with his
Son, and all the great Lords of the Court,
were obliged more than once, to Foot it
over the Mud and the Marshes, fearing to expose
themselves to greater danger, if they
should have passed them on Horse-back.</p>

<p>When they came to Bridges, or those
other obstructions all the Army stayed: And
as soon as the Emperor was passed, with some
of the most considerable Persons, all the rest
came together in a Throng, and every one
striving to pass first, many were tumbled over
into the Water: Others taking Ways more
about, found them more dangerous, falling
into Sloughs and Bogs, out of which they
could not Recover themselves. In fine, there
were so many Inconveniencies to be met with,
in all the Ways of Eastern <em>Tartary</em>, that the
old Officers who had followed the Court above
30 <em>Years</em>, said they had never suffered
so much in any Journy.</p>

<p>It was on those Occasions, that the Emperor
more than once, gave me the Marks
of a Respect altogether particular: the first
Day that we put our Selves in the way for
returning, we were stay'd in the Evening, by a
Torrent so great and rapid, that 'twas impossible
to Ford it: The Emperor having by
chance found a little Boat, which could not
hold above 4 Persons at most, passed first with
his Sons, and some of the Principal Kings
followed: All the other Princes, Lords, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
<em>Mandarines</em>, which the rest of the Army attended,
(in the mean while) with Impatience
the return of the Boat, to carry them to the
other side of the Torrent, because the Night
approached, and the Tents had long before
passed: But the Emperor being come back
to us in such another Boat as the former, demanded
aloud where I was? and his Father
in Law having presented me to him, he added,
let him come in and Cross over with us: So
we were the only Persons that passed with the
Emperor; and all the rest stayed on the Bank,
where they must pass the Night <em>under the open
Heaven</em>: The same thing happened the next
Day almost in the same manner. The Emperor
at Noon meeting with a like rapid and
swelled Torrent, gave order that the Boats
should be made use of for Transporting the
Tents, Packs, and other Baggage till the
Evening; then willed that I should pass alone
with him and some few of his Attendants, having
left on the other side all the great Lords,
who were necessitated to pass the Night
there. The Emperor's Father in Law himself,
having asked if he should not pass with me,
since I Lodged in his Tent and eat at his Table?
this Prince answered him, that he should
stay, and he himself would take Order to give
me what was necessary.</p>

<p>After we had past, the Emperor sitting on
the Bank-side, made me sit by him, with the
two Sons of the two petty Western Kings,
and the first <em>Colao</em> of <em>Tartary</em>, whom he distinguished
on all Occasions.</p>

<p>As the Night was Fair, and the Heavens
very Clear; he willed me to Name in the <em>Chi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>nese</em>
and <em>European</em> Languages, all the Constellations
that then appeared above the Horizon,
and he himself first named all those he
already knew; then unfolding a small Map
of the Heavens, which I had some Years since
presented him, he put himself upon inquiring
the Hour of the Night, by the Stars in the
Meridian: Pleasing himself to shew to all
the Knowledge he had acquired in these Sciences.
All the Marks of his Favours which
he so often gave me, even to the sending me
to Eat from his own Table, these Marks I
say were so Publick, and so Extraordinary;
that the two Unkles of the Emperor, who
bore the Titles of Associates of the Empire,
being on their Return to <em>Pekin</em>, said that
when the Emperor had some Regret or appeared
somewhat Sad, he would Resume his
ordinary Gaiety upon the sight of me.</p>

<p>I arrived at <em>Pekin</em> in perfect Health the 9<em>th</em>
day of <em>June</em> very late, though divers were detained
in the Way by Distempers, or were
returned from their Journy, Hurt and Lamed.</p>

<p>I say nothing of what we did for Religion
in this Journy, having reserved that for a particular
Relation, by which it will appear,
that by the Grace of our Lord, the Favours
we received at the Court of <em>China</em>, produced
considerable Fruits for the Church, and did
not take away the Cross from the Missionaries.</p>

<p>I shall here add the <em>Tartarean</em> Names, and
the distance of every Place through which we
passed in the Eastern <em>Tartary</em>, from the Capital
of the Province of <em>Leao-tum</em> even
to <em>Kirin</em>, according to the order of Days
which we Spent in this Progress. A <em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>Topographic
Chart</em> may be made and inserted into
the Map of the Province of <em>Leao-tum</em>, to be
found in the Atlas of Father <em>Martin Martinius</em>,
by changing only the <em>Latitudes</em> according
to the Heights of the <em>Pole</em>, which we have before
Specified.</p>

<p>I shall add one thing more which I Understood
from the Inhabitants of <em>Ula</em>, to wit
that <em>Nincrita</em> (which is a Place much Renowned
in those Parts) is distant from <em>Ula</em> 700
<em>Chinese Stadia</em> (each of which is 360 <em>Geometrical
Paces</em>) and that Embarking at <em>Nincrita</em>
upon the great River <em>Heleum</em>, into which
the <em>Songoro</em>, and some other more considerable
Rivers are discharged, and following the
course of the River, which runs towards the
North-East, or somewhat more to the North,
they arrive in 40 Days Journy at the Eastern
Sea, which is (as I believe) the Streight of
<em>Anien</em>: I was told this by the General of the
Militia which is at <em>Kirin</em>; and who had performed
this Voyage himself.</p>

<h2><em>A Voyage of the Emperor of <strong>China</strong>,
into the Western <strong>Tartary</strong>, in the
Year, 1683.</em></h2>


<p>The Emperor this Year, which is the
30<em>th.</em> of his Age, made a Voyage into
the Western <em>Tartary</em>, together with the Queen
his Grand-mother, which they call the Queen
<em>Mother</em>; he departed the 16<em>th.</em> of <em>July</em>, in the
Company of more than 60000 Men, and
100000 Horse. He positively resolved, that
I, with one of the two Fathers that were
at the Court of <em>Pekin</em>, the Choice of which
he left to me, should follow him, I chose
Father <em>Philip Grimaldi</em>; because he is the most
known, and because he perfectly understood
the <em>Mathematicks</em>.</p>

<p>Several Reasons prevailed with the Emperor
to Enterprize this Journy. The first
was, that he might keep his Militia during
the Peace as well as in the Wars, in continual
Exercise; and for this Reason it was,
that after he had Establish'd a firm Peace in
all the Quarters of this so vast an Empire;
he recalled his best Troops hither out of
every Province, and resolved in his Council
to make every Year Expeditions of this kind,
in several Seasons, that by hunting of Deer,
Boars, Bears, and Tigers, they might learn
to overcome the Enemies of the Empire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
or at least to prevent the cooling of their
Courage, or the degenerating from their
Pristine Valour, by the Luxury of <em>China</em>, in
a too long Repose.</p>

<p>In effect these kinds of Hunting had more
of the shew of a Military Expedition, than
of one for Divertisement, as I have already
noted: The Emperor took in his Train,
100000 Horse, and above 60000 Men, all
armed with Arrows and Cimiters, divided
into Companies and Marching in Battle-Array
after their Colours, with the sound of
Drums and Trumpets: During their Hunting,
they intirely invested the Mountains and
Forrests, as if they had been Cities which
they design'd to Beleaguer; following in this
the manner of Hunting used by the Eastern
<em>Tartars</em>, of which I have spoken in my last
Letter. This Army had its Van-guard and
Rear-guard, and its Main Body, its Right
Wing and Left Wing, was commanded by so
many Generals and petty Kings. There
were spent more then Seventy Days before
they were on their March, in bringing together
all the Ammunitions of the Army upon
the Waggons, upon the Camels, upon
the Horses, and upon the Mules, by reason
of the Incommodious Ways. For in all the
Western <em>Tartary</em> (I call it Western) not
with Relation to <em>China</em>, which lieth in Respect
of it Westward it self, but with respect
of the Eastern <em>Tartary</em> there is nothing to be
found but Mountains, Rocks, and Vallies;
there are neither Cities, Towns nor Villages,
nor so much as any Houses. The Inhabitants
Lodge under Tents, pitched on all sides in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the open Fields. They are for the most part
Graziers, and transport their Tents from one
Vally to another, according as the Pastures
are better. There they Pasture their Beefs,
their Horses, and their Camels, they breed
no Hogs, nor any of those other Animals,
which elsewhere are fed in the Villages, as
Poultry and Geese. But only of such as the
Herbs, which an uncultivated Land doth Naturally
produce, will serve to sustain. They
pass their Life either in Hunting, or doing
nothing. And as they neither sow nor cultivate
the Earth, so they make no Harvest.
They Live upon Milk, Cheese, and Flesh,
and have a sort of Wine, not much unlike
our Aqua-vitæ; with which they make their
Feasts, and are often Drunk. In short they
care for nought from Morning to Night,
but to Drink and Eat; like the Beasts, and
Droves which they Feed.</p>

<p>They are not without their Priests, which
they call <em>Lamas</em>, for whom they have a singular
Veneration, in which they differ from
the Oriental <em>Tartars</em>; the most part of whom
have no Religion, nor do they believe any
God. For the rest both of the one and the
other are Slaves, and wholly depend upon
the will of their Masters, whose Religion
and Manners they blindly follow: Like in
this to their Droves, who go where they are
lead, and not where they ought to go.</p>

<p>This part of <em>Tartary</em>, lies without the
prodigious Wall of <em>China</em> about 1000 <em>Chinese
Stadia</em>, that is to say more than 300 <em>European</em>
Miles, and extends from the North-east towards
the North.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>The Emperor Rides on Horse-back, in the
Head of his Army through these Desert Places,
and these Steep Mountains, and far from
great Roads, exposed all the Day to the
Scorchings of the Sun, to the Rains, and to
all the Injuries of the Air. Many of those
which had been in the last War, assured me,
that they had not suffered so much during all
that as during this Hunting. In so much
that the Emperor, whose principal Aim it
was to give his Forces a Breathing, performed
effectually what he pretended.</p>

<p>The second Reason he had of undertaking
this Journy, was that he might keep the
Western <em>Tartars</em> in their Duty, and to prevent
any pernitious Designs that might be
formed against the States.</p>

<p>It was for this that he entred their Country
with so great an Army, and with so great
Preparations for War. Having carried along
several great Guns, that he might cause them
to be Discharged from time to time into the
Vallies, and by the Noise and Fire which
issued out of the Mouths of those Dragons,
which served to Ornament them, he might
cast a Dread upon the Rout.</p>

<p>Besides this great Retinue, he would yet
be accompanied with all the Marks of Grander,
with which he was environed at the
Court at <em>Pekin</em>. To wit, with a Multitude
of Drums, Trumpets, Timbals, and other
Musical Instruments, which formed Consorts
During his sitting at Table, when he entred
the Palace, or when he went out. He caused
all these to March with him, that he might
by this outward Pomp Astonish these <em>Bar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>barous</em>
People, to strike them with a Fear and
Respect of his Imperial Majesty.</p>

<p>For the Empire of <em>China</em> never had any
Enemies more to be feared than these Western
<em>Tartars</em>; which beginning on the East of
<em>China</em> encompass it with an almost infinite of
People, and keep it as it were continually beleaguered
on the North and West sides thereof;
and 'twas to make a Bulwork against
their Incursions, that a <em>Chinese</em> Emperor in
antient Times caused this great Wall to be
Built, which separates <em>China</em> from their Country.
I have passed it four times, and have considered
it very attentively. And I can say
without Hyperbolizing, that all the seven
Wonders of the World put together, are not
comparable to this Work. And all that
Fame has spread concerning it among the
<em>Europeans</em>, is far short of what I my self have
seen.</p>

<p>Two things have more especially caused
my Admiration. The first is, that in this
long extent from the East to the West, it
passes in several places not only through vast
Champains, but also above the tops of exceeding
high Mountains, upon which it is
raised by little and little, and fortify'd at
certain Intervals with great Towers; not
distant the one from the other more than
two flight Shot. At our return I had the
Curiosity to measure the height of it in one
place by means of an Instrument, and I found
that it was in that Place 1037 Geometrical
Feet above the Horison; in such sort that
'tis hard to comprehend how 'twas possible to
elevate this enormous Bulwork to the height<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
we saw it, in places dry and full of Mountains,
whence they must be obliged to bring
from a great distance with incredible Labour,
the Water, Brick, Mortar, and all
the Materials necessary for so great a
Work.</p>

<p>The second thing that surprized me was,
that this Wall is not continued upon the
same Line, but bent in divers places following
the situation of the Mountains, in such
manner, that instead of one Wall, one may
say that there are three, which Environ all this
great part of <em>China</em>.</p>

<p>After all, The Monarch which in our Days
hath re-united the <em>Chinese</em> and the <em>Tartars</em>,
under one and the same Government, has
done some things more for the advantage of
the security of <em>China</em>, than the <em>Chinese</em> Emperor
that built the long Wall. For after
having reduced the Western <em>Tartars</em>, partly
by Artifice, partly by force of Arms: He
has obliged to go and remain at 300 Miles
distance from the Wall of <em>China</em>; and in this
Place he distributes to them Land and Pastures,
whilst he has given their Country to
other <em>Tartars</em>, his Subjects which have their
Habitation there at present: Notwithstanding
which, these Western <em>Tartars</em> are so powerful,
that if they should agree together,
they might make themselves Masters of all
<em>China</em>, and of the Eastern <em>Tartary</em>, even in
the Face of the Oriental <em>Tartars</em>.</p>

<p>I have said, that the <em>Tartarian</em> Monarch
that conquered <em>China</em>, used an expedient for
subduing the Western <em>Tartars</em>. For one of
his first Cares was to engage to his Interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
by his Royal Bounties, and by demonstration
of a Singular Affection, the <em>Lamas</em> (or
<em>Priests</em>) these Men having a great Repute about
all those of their Nation, easily perswaded
them to submit to the Government
of so great a Prince; and 'tis in consideration
of this Service done to the Estate, that
the present Emperor looks upon these <em>Lamas</em>
with a favourable Eye, that he bestows
Presents on them; and that he makes use of
them to keep the <em>Tartars</em> in the Obedience
which they owe him: Tho' at the bottom he
hath nothing but Dis-esteem for their Persons,
and looks upon them as a sort of Ignorant
Fellows, which have not the least
Tincture of the Sciences or commendable
Arts, in which without doubt this Prince
shews a Wise Policy, in so disguising his true
Sentiments, by these exterior Marks of Esteem
and Good-will.</p>

<p>He has divided this vastly extended Country
into 48 Provinces, who have submitted
and are Tributary to him. From whence it
comes to pass, that the Emperor that Reigns
at present in <em>China</em>, and in the one and the
other <em>Tartary</em>, may justly be called the greatest
and most powerful Monarch of <em>Asia</em>, having
so many vast Estates under him, without
being any where interrupted by the Territory
of any Foreign Prince, and he alone
being as the Soul which gives motion to all the
Members of so vast a Body.</p>

<p>For after he had charged himself with the
Government, he did not at all intrust the
Care to any of the <em>Colaos</em>, nor to any of the
great Men of his Court. He has not at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
suffered, that the Eunuchs of the Palace, or
any of his Pages, or any of the young Lords
that have been raised by him, should dispose
of the least thing in his House, or should regulate
any thing of themselves: Which appears
very extraordinary; especially if we
examin what Customs his Predecessors were
wont to use.</p>

<p>He chastises with wonderful Equity the
great Ones as well as the Inferiors; he deprives
them of their Charges, and makes
them descend from the Rank they held, proportioning
always the Penalty to the heinousness
of their Fault. He takes Cognisance
of the Affairs which are transacted in the
Royal Counsel, and in the other Tribunals,
even to the causing them to render to him
an exact account of the Judgments there given.
In one Word, he of himself Disposes
and Orders all things; and 'tis by reason of
the absolute Authority which he hath thus
acquired, that the greatest Lords of the
Court, and Persons of the highest Quality
in the Empire; even the Princes of the
Blood, never appear in his Presence, but with
a profound Respect.</p>

<p>But to what remains, the <em>Lamas</em> or <em>Tartarian</em>
Priests, of whom we have spoken, are
not only respected by the People, but also by
the Lords and Princes of their Nation, who
for Politick Ends testifie to them a great
deal of Friendship: This makes us fear that
the Christian Religion, will not find so easie
an entrance into the Western <em>Tartary</em>. They
are also very powerful upon the Mind of the
Queen Mother, who is of their Country, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
who is at present Threescore and Ten Years
Old; they are wont to tell her, that the Sect
(of which she makes Profession) has no more
declared Enemies than us. And 'tis a kind of
Miracle, or at least an extraordinary Protection
of God, that notwithstanding this, the Emperor,
who has very much regard and respect
for her, has not hitherto ceased to heap
on us Graces and Honours, considering us
after another manner than the <em>Lamas</em>.</p>

<p>During the Journey, as the Princes and the
chief Officers of the Army went oftentimes
to the Queen to attend at her Court; and
that we also were advertised to do so likewise:
We were willing first to consult a Person
of the Court, who loved us very much,
and who spake for us to the Emperor in
our Affairs. This Lord having enter'd the
Princes Tent, told him what had passed,
and presently coming out again: <em>The Emperor</em>
(said he to us) <em>has given me to understand,
that 'tis not at all necessary for you to attend the
Queen as others do</em>; which made us to apprehend
enough, that this Princess did not favour
us.</p>

<p>The 3d Reason which the Emperor had
for making this Journey, was for his Health:
because he knew by his Experience long
enough, that when he is too long at <em>Pekin</em>
without going Abroad, he cannot avoid his
being attacked by several Distempers, which
he prevents by means of these long Progresses.
For during the whole time he never
sees any Woman; and that which is more
surprizing, there appears not any one in all
this great Army, except those which are of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the Retinue of the Queen Mother: 'Tis yet
also a Novelty that she has accompanyed the
King this Year, it having not been practiced
above once, when he took with him the
three Queens as far as the Capital City of the
Province of <em>Leao-tum</em>, to visit the Sepulchers
of their Ancestors.</p>

<p>The Emperor and the Queen Mother pretend
moreover by this Journey, to avoid the
excessive Heats which are in <em>Pekin</em>, in the
Summer during the Dog-days. For in this
part of <em>Tartary</em>, there reigns during the
Months of <em>July</em> and <em>August</em> so cold a Wind,
especially in the Night, that 'tis necessary to put
on thick Cloths and Furs. The Reason that
may be assigned for this so extraordinary Cold,
is that this Region is very much elevated and
full of Mountains: There is one among the
rest, upon which we continually ascended,
for the space of 5 or 6 Days March. The
Emperor being desirous to know how much
it surmounted the Plains of <em>Pekin</em>, distant about
300 Miles; at our return (after having
measured the height of above a hundred
Mountains that lay in our Road) we found
that it had 3000 Geometrical Pace of Elevation,
above the Sea that nearest approached
<em>Pekin</em>.</p>

<p>The Salt Peter also with which these Countries
abound, may contribute to this great
Cold, which is so violent, that in digging
the Earth to three or four Foot deep, there
are fetched out Clods all frozen, and pieces of
Ice.</p>

<p>Divers of the Petty Kings of the Western
<em>Tartary</em>, came from all sides for 300 Miles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and some for 500 Miles, together with their
Children, to salute the Emperor. These
Princes, who for the most part know none
but by their own natural Language, which
is very different from that of the Eastern
<em>Tartary</em>: Took regard of us, with Aspects
and Gestures of a goodness very particular.
There were some among them, who had made
a Journey to <em>Pekin</em> to see the Court, and who
had seen our Church.</p>

<p>One or two Days before we arrived at the
Mountain which was the boundary of our
Journey, we met a Petty King very aged,
who returned from accompanying the Emperor,
he seeing us stayed with all his Retinue,
and enquired by his Interpreter, which of
us was called <em>Nauboaij</em>; one of our Servants
having made a sign that it was I, this Prince
accosted me with a great deal of Civility,
and told me that for a long time he had
known my Name, and that he had desired to
know me. He spoke also to Father <em>Grimaldi</em>,
with the same marks of Affection. The favourable
Entertainment he gave us in this
Re-encounter, gave some Reason to hope
that our Religion might find an easie Entrance
to those Princes, particularly if care be
taken to insinuate into the Minds of those
Princes, by the means of the Mathematicks:
Which if there should at any time be a design
to penetrate into their Country, the most
sure way for divers Reasons, (which I have
not the leisure to explain here) will be to begin
the entrance with the other <em>Tartars</em> more
remote, which are not all Subjects of this
Empire, from whom we may pass on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
these, advancing by little and little towards
<em>China</em>.</p>

<p>During the whole Journey, the Emperor
has continued to give us singular Tokens of
his good Will, shewing us Favours in the
sight of his Army, which he shewed to none
besides.</p>

<p>One time meeting us in a great Valley,
where we were measuring the height and
the distance of some Mountains, he made a
stay with the whole Court; and calling to us
from a great distance, he demanded of us
in the <em>Chinese</em> Language, <em>Hao-mo?</em> that is to
say, are you well in Health? And then asked
us several Questions in the <em>Tartarian</em> Language,
concerning the heighth of these Mountains,
to which I answered also in the same
Language; after which, turning to the
Lords that were about him, he discoursed
with them concerning us in very obliging Expressions,
as I learned the same Night from
the Prince his Unkle, who was then by his side.</p>

<p>He testifyed also his Affection to us, by
causing often Meat to be carry'd to our
Tents from his own Table, willing also that
on some Occasions we should eat in his; and
every time he did us this Honour, he had a
regard to our Days of Abstinence, and of
Fasting, sending us only such Meats as we
could use.</p>

<p>The eldest Son of the Emperor, after the
Example of his Father, gave us marks also
of his Bounty, for having been constrained
to stay more than 10 Days, by reason of a
fall from his Horse, by which he was hurt
in his right Shoulder; and one part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
Army in which we were, having attended,
whilst the Emperor with the other, continued
his Hunting, he was not wanting in
sending to us daily, and sometimes twice a
Day, during this space, Food from his own
Table. In fine, we look'd on all these Favours
of the Royal Family, as the effects of
a particular Providence which watched over
us, and over Christianity, for which we had
so much the more occasion to thank God,
for that the affection of the Emperor, was
never so constantly shewn to the Grandees
of the Empire, nor to the Princes of
the Blood.</p>

<p>As to what relates to the other particularities
of our Journey, they are like to those
which happened to us the last Year, in the
Journey to the Eastern <em>Tartary</em>, which I have
fully described in my last Letter; that is to
say, that we made use of the Emperor's Horses,
and of his Litters, that we lodged in the
Tents, and eat at the Table of the Prince
his Unkle, to whom he had particularly recommended
us.</p>

<p>During more than 600 Miles, which we had
passed in going and returning (for we did
not return by the same Road) he caused to
be made a great High-way cross the Mountains
and the Vallies, for the Queen Mother,
who went in a Chariot; he caused also an infinite
number of Bridges to be made over the
Torrents, as also the Rocks to be cut, and the
Points of the Mountains, with incredible
Pains and Expences: Father <em>Grimaldi</em> shall describe
the other particulars in his Letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the benefit which the Religion may
draw from our Journey, I have spoken elsewhere;
it sufficeth to say that the Emperor,
to whose Will we cannot make the least resistance,
without exposing all this Mission to
a manifest Danger, has order'd us to follow
him. I ceased not however to speak twice
to that Lord of the Court, who is our particular
Friend, to excuse us for the time to
come from these long Journeys, and especially
me, <em>who am not of an Age fit for it</em>: I
tried to obtain at least that they would be
contented to take only one of us; the Letters
of our Fathers were daily brought us
during the Journey, and I had the convenience
of writing to them, by means of the
Couriers which continually went to and came
from the Royal City: I write all this in haste,
that I may continue to give you an account
of our Affairs.</p>

<h2><em>An Explanation, necessary to justify
the <strong>Geography</strong> supposed in
these Letters.</em></h2>


<p>It may seem wonderful, that the Author
of these Letters makes mention in his
former, of a kind of War between the <em>Oriental
Tartars</em> and the <em>Muscovites</em>, notwithstanding
the extream distance these People
appear to be from one another in our
Geographical Charts; but those who know
how much the <em>Muscovites</em> have extended
the Bounds of the Empire along the <em>Tartarian</em>
Sea, will judge the thing less difficult,
besides those who have seen these Countries,
have made Discoveries much differing from
those which our Geographers have informed
us of hitherto. Very lately <em>Monsieur D'Arcy</em>,
who commands one of the King's Ships, in
the Fleet of <em>Monsieur Le Marescal d'Estrees</em>,
informed us, that having served in <em>Poland</em>,
and having been made Governor of a Place
towards <em>Moscovy</em>, the <em>Moscovite</em> Ambassadors
in their return having pass'd by him,
and being by him treated in such a manner
as put them into a very good Humour; one
of them shewed him a Chart of the Countries
between <em>Moscovy</em> and <em>China</em>: and told
him, that from three Cities which he shewed
him, whose Names were <em>Lopsla</em>, <em>Abasinko</em>,
<em>Nerginsko</em>, all three under the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
of the great Dukes, tho' situated in the great
<em>Tartary</em>, there was a way to <em>Pekin</em>, which
was not more than 25 or 30 Days Journey.
This Map it seems must be kept very secret
in <em>Moscovy</em>: For the next Day the <em>Moscovite</em>
was in despair, for having given it, saying
that if it should be known, he should
come to great Damage. The Officer being
come back since into <em>France</em>, has given a
Copy to the King, and another to <em>Monsieur
Le Marquis de Signelay</em>. To confirm this, it
may be added, what a <em>French</em> Man has writ
from <em>Moscovy</em> within this two Months, that
they are actually raising Troops to go to
War with the <em>Chinese</em>.</p>

<h2><em>Some Observations and Conjectures
concerning the <strong>Chinese</strong>
Characters. Made by <strong>R. H.</strong>
R. S. S.</em></h2>


<p>Whether there ever were any Language
natural, I dispute not: But that
there have been, are, and may be, artificial
Languages 'tis not difficult to prove. The
<em>Chinese</em> Court Language is said to be of this
kind, invented and spoken by the <em>Literati</em>
and <em>Mandarines</em> throughout the whole Empire
of <em>China</em>, differing from all the other
Languages spoken in it, and I conjecture it
to be nothing else but the Names of the
Character by which they write and express
their meaning, arbitrarily imposed by them,
as we in <em>Europe</em> set names to Arithmetical
Figures, not as we pronounce Words written
with a litteral Character. This I Judge
by comparing the Characters with the Names,
Monosyllables or Words they pronounce and
read them with. Nor do they ascend above
a Monosyllabical Name, tho' the Character
be composed of many single Characters, each
of which hath its proper Sense, and Monosyllabical
Name, and though the meaning of
each Character, be an ingredient in the
Notion of that compounded Character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>I might give an Instance also in the Artificial
Language Invented by the Late Reverend
Bishop of <em>Chester</em> Dr. <em>Wilkins</em>, which
in all the accomplishments of Language doth
excel any one yet extant; to which is also
annexed a real Character, Legible into that
or any other Language Spoken. By which
Language the Character and every additional
Mark is effable, and yet the Character is not
Literal but Real, which is more curious and
useful than the <em>Chinese</em> way. Great pity it
is that Discourse is not published in Latin,
that the Learned of <em>Europe</em>, may think of
further Improving it, and bringing it to
Use.</p>

<p>But whatever we may judge of Language,
'tis past dispute that Writing was ever Artificial,
how Antiently so ever it were in Use,
and was the Invention of some thinking and
Studious Men. 'Tis also evident that there
have been various ways thought of for Expressing
Significancy, according to the several
<em>Genii</em> of the Persons that were the Inventors.
As may be guessed by the <em>Ægyptian</em>
Hieroglyphicks, the <em>Chinese</em> Characters, the
<em>Mexican</em> Chronology, and the Literal Characters
of several Nations, each of which
seem to proceed upon differing methods, and
from differing thoughts of Invention.</p>

<p>Which of these ways is the most Antient,
is hard to prove. The <em>Ægyptian Mummies</em>
and <em>Obelesks</em> prove a great Antiquity of the
Hieroglyphicks, but yet the <em>Chinese</em> Chronology
(if to be credited) outstrips the <em>Ægyptian</em>
in pretence to Antiquity. For the <em>Chinese</em>
make <em>Fohi</em>, the first King of <em>China</em>, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
the inventer of their Character: And account
him to have lived 2950 Years before
the time of Christ, during all which time
they pretend to have a certain and written
Account in their Books: But their Account
of the times preceding, they esteem more
Hypothetical and Fabulous; depending chiefly
upon Fiction and Oral Tradition: As you
will easily believe, when you understand how
many Years they make it since the Creation of
the World to the present Year 1686. which by
the Account thereof in Mr. <em>Graves</em>'s Translation
of <em>Vulg. Beig.</em> will be found to be no
less than eighty eight millions six hundred
and forty thousand one hundred and two
Solar Years, there having been run out since
the Creation 8864 <em>Ven.</em> of Years (every <em>Ven.</em>
containing ten thousand such Years) and of
the present <em>Ven.</em> this Year 1686. is the 102d.
Which Account is abundantly more extravagant
than the <em>Ægyptian</em>: But this need not
invalidate their History since <em>Fohi</em>; by which
it appears that their Character was invented
before the time of <em>Moses</em> about 1400
Years, and even before <em>Menes</em> the first King
of <em>Ægypt</em> about 500 Years. So that the <em>Chinese</em>
Invention of Writing or Characters,
seems to be the most ancient of that kind.
And the Book <em>Yekim</em> said to be written by
<em>Fohi</em>, the most antient Book.</p>

<p>These Accounts made me the more desirous
to understand somewhat of the Reality
and Truth, of what is related concerning
the Knowledge of Literature and manual
Arts, which these People of <em>China</em> are said to
have possessed so long a time in so great Per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>fection,
and without Alteration from the
primitive Institution, especially upon the Account
of their Art of Printing, which gave
a hint to the Inventors of that admirable
and most useful of all Inventions (for the
Common Wealth of Learning) the way of
Printing here in <em>Europe</em>. For <em>Paulus Jovius</em>
affirms that the first occasion of that Invention
in <em>Germany</em>, was a <em>German</em> Merchant,
who returning out of <em>China</em> into his own
Country, related what he had observed concerning
the Practice of it as used in that
Country. And tho' the <em>Chinese</em> way be
wholly differing as to the method of composing,
from what was invented and perfected
here: Yet such an intimation was enough to
an ingenious Artist to improve the first Contrivance,
and make it more accomodate to
the literal way of Writing with us: And as
our way may possibly be now brought to the
greatest Perfection for exactness and expedition,
so without doubt must be their way of
Printing any thing just as it is written, since
I find, that they can engrave their Stamps
for a Sheet, as soon as one of our Compositers
can set and correct a Sheet of our literal
Character, and when so done, one Man alone
will print off 1500 Sheets in one Day. And
though 'tis generally believed to be much the
same with our Wooden Cuts for Printing,
yet from some Observations I have made, I
believe it to be much another way; of which
I shall hereafter say more when I describe their
other Arts of Pottery, Staining, Varnishing,
<em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>By a <em>Chinese</em> Manuscript, out of which I
transcribed the Lord's Prayer in the Year
1666 (when it was lost) I found that the Pronunciations
had no affinity with the stroaks
of the Character. Whence I conceived it
was either a numeral Character consisting of
Numbers, or else a real Character, but not
a literal, unless it were a literal Character of
some other Language than that by which it
was pronounced, whose pronunciation is lost
though the significancy be retained, as if
one should read what is written in <em>Hebrew</em>
בראשיהברא into the <em>Latin</em> or <em>Roman</em> Language,
<em>In Principio Cræavit</em> instead of <em>Brasit
bra</em>, or <em>Beresith Bara</em> according to the <em>Masorethæ</em>.</p>

<p>Since that time I procured from <em>China</em>, a
Dictionary of the Court Language, (as I
found it written upon by the Person that
sent it me from thence) but this whole Book
(which I found was Printed) consisted only of
the <em>Chinese</em> Characters without any Interpretation,
or Pronunciation; however by the
help of the Pictures of that, and a <em>Chinese</em>
Almanack, I quickly found out their Characters
for Numbers, and their way of Numeration,
together with the Figure and Use of
their <em>Abacus</em> or counting Board, for performing
the Operations of <em>Arithmetick</em>, which I
find pretty near to agree with that of the
antient <em>Romans</em> (a Description and Picture
of which is given by <em>Ursinus</em>, <em>Pignorius</em> and
<em>Velserus</em>) save only, that, instead of Pins
and sliding Groves of the <em>Roman</em>, the <em>Chinese
Abacus</em> hath Strings or Wires and Beads, to
slide upon them; and that, instead of four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Pins for Digits or Units, the <em>Chinese</em> hath
five Beads: So that it may seem to argue
that the <em>Chinese Abacus</em> was designed for a <em>Duodecimal</em>
Progression: Whereas that of the
<em>Romans</em> was design'd for the <em>Decimal</em>.</p>

<p>One thing is remarkable in the <em>Chinese</em>,
that I find the <em>Abacus</em> to lie Horizontal, and
their first place to be that next the left Hand,
which I judge was also the first in their old
way of reading, much the same with ours,
though their other Characters are erected
(as I shall by and by shew) from the posture
of Writing and Reading, which I conjecture
they did at first make use of; and what does
yet further agree with this conjecture, is remarkable
in the newly mentioned Treatise
of <em>Vulg. Beig.</em> That whereas the way of
Writing and Reading used by the <em>Arabs</em>, was
from the right to the left, the first place or
the place of Units in their Numeration, was
that next the right Hand; and so came first to
be read: As did that of <em>China</em>, who as I conceive
read the contrary way, from the left to
the right.</p>

<p>It appears therefore by this Remark that
we received this way of expressing Numbers
from the <em>Arabians</em>, for that we keep the same
posture or position of places with them, tho'
our progression in Writing and Reading be
the contrary way. And though we now
read them also in the order they are set,
twenty one, twenty two, thirty six, forty
eight, <em>&amp;c.</em> yet we retain also the other way
of Pronouncing, <em>viz.</em> one and twenty, two
and twenty, six and thirty, eight and forty,
<em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>Now as the <em>Chinese</em> and <em>Roman Abacus</em> do
much agree save only that they proceed
contrary ways, so doth their way of
expressing Numbers by Letters or Marks,
one stroke or line signifying one; two lines
two; three lines three; a cross ten; two
crosses twenty; three crosses thirty; and so onwards
to a hundred, which they expressed by
a square Mark, and a cross with a stroak added
for a thousand, as will appear by the
Table annexed. And though the Characters
are not all the same; yet the order and
method of one agrees very near with that of
the other, especially if I may be allowed my
supposition, that the primitive way of Writing
and Reading with the <em>Chinese</em> was Horizontal,
and like the <em>Greek</em> and <em>Latin</em> or <em>European</em>
way. Now that these are properly
numeral Figures, or Characters, is manifest
from this, that they have also word Characters
for every Number, and they can (in
the same manner as the <em>Romans</em> could) express
a Number by their numeral characters
or Marks, and by their literal or word Characters;
for as one single stroak signifies one
or the first, so does the Character (<em>in the Plate
marked with E</em>) signify the same thing, that is
one or the first.</p>

<p>Having thus discovered their Characters
for Numbers, and their way of Numeration,
I was next desirous to understand something
concerning their Language and Character.</p>

<p>Upon perusing all the Accounts I could
meet with in Books, I found very little satisfaction
as to what I principally inquired af<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>ter,
which was first concerning the method
of the Character, whether it consisted of a
certain number of Marks methodically disposed
like Letters in a literal, or like Numbers
in a Numeral, or like Radicals in composite
and decomposite Derivations? 'Tis said
to be legible into a great many Languages
considerably different one from another, but
how this is effected is not related, only 'tis
said that the Marks are of the nature of our
Arithmetical Figures, (which are become almost
Universal at least to us here in <em>Europe</em>,)
and 2dly, concerning the number of these Characters?
to which I found as little satisfaction;
for, by some Relations I found that there
were 120000, by others 80000, and by others
60000. And that a Man must be able to
remember to Write and Read at least 8000,
or 10000, before he will be able to express
his meaning thereby, and that it is the business
of a Man's whole Life to be throughly
understanding in the whole Character; seeming
to intimate that the Characters are immethodical,
and there are as many primitive
Characters as Words. Others tell us of various
kinds of Characters which have been in
use in several Ages. The first they say were
<em>Hieroglyphical</em> like the <em>Ægyptian</em> or <em>Mexican</em>,
consisting of the Pictures of Animals and Vegetables.
But that the last are made up of
Lines and Points, that they have no such
thing as Letters or Syllables, but every distinct
Word and Notion has a distinct Character,
and that all are primitive or in composite,
so that if <em>Calepines</em> Dictionary were to
be translated into the <em>Chinese</em>, 'twere neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>sary
to have as many distinct radical Characters
as there are Words therein to be found,
which accounts do seem to insinuate that this
Character is the most difficult, and the most
perplexed piece of Learning in the World,
and depends wholly upon the strength of the
Memory, in retaining the form and signification
of a perplexed scrawl. But whether
they who gave us these Accounts did do
it knowingly, is much to be doubted, my own
Observations, at least, make me think otherwise.</p>

<p>I have not yet been able to procure sufficient
helps to inform my self of the whole
Art of Writing and Reading the <em>Chinese</em> Character,
and I fear the Relations I have hitherto
met with concerning it, were written
by such as did not well understand it, however
from such helps as I had, what I collected
or do conjecture, I shall here relate. The
best help I had, was the perusal of some Books
Printed in <em>China</em>, with the pronunciation and
signification of the Character in Latin Letters.
By these Books then I observed, first,
that every one of their Characters, whether
consisting of more or fewer strokes or marks,
were comprised within a certain square space,
which is proportion'd according to the bigness
of the size or manner of Writing, they
design there to make use of, not that the
whole Square is filled with every Character,
but that no part of that Character does exceed
the limits of that Square, so that tho'
the Character have but one stroak, it takes
as much room in the line as another that hath
20 or 30 several Marks, so that their Cha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>racters
are most exactly ranged in Rank
and File, not unlike our Numbers in Arithmetick.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding which I find they do vary
the bigness of the Character upon several
Occasions, as in the Titles of Books, in the
Titles of the Chapters or Sections, in the
Comments, Explications or Notes, and upon
several other occasions of variety, which
they do at Pleasure with their Pencil, as we
use variety of Letters in the Printing of a
Book. The Titles of Books are generally in
very large Characters, 6 or 8 times as big as
those of the Book, the explication Notes ½
of the bigness, the Contents usually twice as
big, and the like variety on several other
occasions. I have met with also three several
kinds of Characters, the most usual
is the fixed or set square form. The second
sort is the running Hand, in which the orders
of the Courts are written by their Secretaries,
of which I have seen 3 or 4 kinds,
in which the Pencil is never taken off, till
the whole Character be finished, and sometimes
two or three are all written without
break. The third seems to be somewhat
like the flourishing great Letters, used by
Scriveners at the beginning of Deeds, and
by the <em>Germans</em> in the beginning of Chapters
and Sections. They are compounded of the
same strokes as the set Character, but modulated
and shaped a little otherwise to make
them appear the more beautiful and regular.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
A Specimen of each of these three are in the
Plate. This third is made use of for Epitaphs,
and other Inscriptions on Buildings or
Monuments. These three sorts I may call
the three general kinds of Writing, but there
is to be found an almost infinite variety of
forms which Men use. This will be the more
easie to be believed, when we consider that
the Printed Characters are exactly the same
with the Written, insomuch that every variety
in each stroke, line or point, that is
or can be made with the Pencil, is perfectly
expressed in the Impression, and the Form,
Mode, or Hand, as we call it, of every Writer
is exhibited so curiously, that I think it
hardly possible to be performed after the way
of wooden Cuts, as Authors affirm it is,
but must be done after the method of our
Copper Cuts, Printed by a Roll-press, which
the way of expressing the Running or Court-Hand,
does, I conceive, most evidently demonstrate,
and from divers circumstances, I
could evidently make appear from the Book
it self, which I cannot so well express in
Writing. Their Paper is generally very thin
and fine, and very transparent, but brown,
so that whatever is Written or Printed on it,
is almost as legible on the back, as on the
foreside, which is of great use in the cutting
of their Stamps. And thence they never
Write or Print on both sides of the same
Leaf, but only on one, and to make the Leaf
appear Printed on both sides, they double
the Sheet with the Printed sides outwards,
and putting the folded part forward, they
Sew, Bind, or Stitch together, all these Sheets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
with the cut Edges, and upon whole Sheets
instead of single Leaves; just in the same
manner as the Plate annexed to this Discourse
is Printed. They begin the Book on the top
of the right Hand side of the Page that is
next the right Hand, and they read downwards
to the bottom, then begin the next
Line towards the left Hand at the top, and
so read to the bottom, and so proceed to the
end of the Book. But this I suppose not to
be the primitive or first way of Writing
or Reading. The Title of the Book is set
first upon a whole Leaf, usually of a thicker
Paper, and some Title is likewise Written
upon the folding or edge of every Sheet,
where is set also the Number of the Book,
and the Number of the Sheet, half of which
appears on one side, and half on the other
side of the fold.</p>

<p>As to the Character it self, (I find by all
the Books and Writings I have yet met with
of that kind) that each of them is made up
of a certain number of Strokes, Lines or
Marks, which are very distinct from each
other in their shape and position, and by reason
that these are single Strokes, and as I
conceive uncompounded, I think they may
be called the Letters, Elements or Particles,
out of which the more compounded Characters
are constructed or contexed. These are
the first kind of which there are but a very
few, and I think those I have described
in the thirteenth Line of the Plate are
all.</p>

<p>Two, three, four, or more of these joined
together in a certain order and contex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>ture
(in the doing of which there is a great
Regularity and Order observed, which is
not varied from, and all within the regular
square Space) I conceive do make Syllables
or primitive radical Characters, each of which
have a primitive, single or distinct Notion
or Signification as well as Sound, which is
made much use of in the more compounded
Characters or Words. Of this kind I take
the Figures of the Numbers to be: If at least
they are not single Letters like the way of
expressing Numbers in the <em>Hebrew</em>, <em>Greek</em>,
<em>Arabick</em>, &amp;c. Languages, for though there
may be two or three of the single strokes
joyned together into a compound Character,
it hinders not, but that it may still signify a
Letter, as in the <em>Greek</em> ΛΑ.Δ.Ι.Γ.Π.Γ. In the
Runick; where every Letter hath one upright
Line and some other additional Marks:
In the <em>Roman</em> I.L.F.E.O.Q.V.Y: Or it may
signify a Syllable as in the <em>Æthiopick</em>, and
in the <em>Hanscret</em>, and <em>Sunscrit</em> Languages and
Characters: The first of which being the
<em>Brackmans</em> Character we find in <em>P. Kircher</em>'s
<em>China Illustrata</em>, described by <em>P. Roth</em> who studied
it seven Years; and the second (being
a literal Character used over all <em>India</em> by
the Merchants) I have seen in a Transcript,
brought lately out of <em>India</em> by a very Worthy
Gentleman who lived there many Years,
and had the Curiosity to cause to be Transcribed
and Translated also into English,
a Dictionary of their Language in their own
Character: who did me the favour to let
me peruse it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>In which Characters or ways of Writing a
Vowel is always join'd with a Consonant into
one compound Character to make it effable.
And then the single Strokes may be taken
for single ineffable Letters as are the Consonants,
and the composition of two or three
(of which one at least may be a Vowel) will
make Syllables.</p>

<p>Of this kind, there are not so many in the
whole <em>Chinese</em> Character, but that it will be
easie enough to assign each a proper Monosyllable
which shall only have 1 or 2 Consonants,
and one or two Vowels; that is, the
Consonants together, and not separate, either
both behind the Vowel or Vowels, if
it be a Diphthong or both after it or them.</p>

<p>Of this kind, I understand there are about
500, probably 8×8×8, or 512. I could enumerate
a great many, and give you also the
Name or Words by which they are pronounced
as also their signification, but (as I said
before) first, I conceive the present <em>Chinese</em>
Language to have no affinity at all with the
Character, the true primitive, or first Language,
or Pronunciation of it, having been
lost. And secondly, I want some further
help to make a full and compleat Discovery:
What I have learn'd from the Book of <em>Fohi</em>
I shall give the next opportunity; which will
explain the reason of the multiplication of 8.
and the order and method of places in the
Letter or Word square.</p>

<p>The third sort of Characters, is a decompounded
sort being made up of two, three or
more of those of the second kind, diminish'd
proportionably in their size, either as to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
length, or breadth, or both, from what they
have in the same Writing when they are single
and fill up the whole Letter square or Words
square. For there being several of them to
be crouded together within the same square,
according as there are more in number, so
they are always more squeezed together. In this
decompound sort, there is a regular Order
observed in the placing of the several Characters
of the 2d sort; there being some
that are always on the left side, some always
on the right, some at the top, some at the
bottom. Of which I doubt not but that they
have a certain regular Method, which had we
Dictionaries explained, would be easie enough
to be discovered.</p>

<p>This method alone of crouding together
all the Characters (how many soever go to
make up the decompounded Character) into
one square (which is of the same size for the
most Simple and for the most Compound) seems
to be the great singularity, by which the <em>Chinese</em>
Characters differ from those of all the rest of the
World. And this I conceive has been the reason
why all People, and possibly even the very <em>Chinese</em>
themselves have, and do believe it to be a
real and not a literal Character: For if the
primitive Language, or pronunciation of the
Characters be lost (as I conceive it is) and
that the disposition, order, method, texture,
or manner of placing the more simple in the
more compound Characters be also lost, forgotten,
or not understood; then the whole
Characters becomes a real and not a literal
Character: And an immethodical one to such
as want a method, that must be learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
by rote, and depend wholly upon the strength
of the Memory to retain it. But I conceive
it might be at first either a literal Character,
and so the whole square Character was composed
of so many distinct Letters or Syllables,
which composed the Word signified
thereby; and so there might be a regular
Order of placing these Letters in the Character,
that is, that the whole square being
divided into so many parts, there was a
Rule which was the first, second, third and
fourth place: so that there being placed in
those the several Letters that made up the
Word, according to the order they had in
the Word, it was easie by that Rule to Decipher
the said Character, and thence to
find the Word and the Signification, as regularly
as if the Letters had been written
one after another, as most other literal Characters
we know are at this Day written.</p>

<p>Or Secondly, it might be a real Character
consisting of divers Marks or Letters, that
expressed so many simple Notions, several
of which joined together might make up the
more compounded Characters, of which I
have added some Examples in the Plate,
which may be also made literal and pronounceable,
tho' that consideration were not
made use of, when they were first invented.
What things I have observed in my <em>Chinese</em>
Books that seem to respect this Method, I
will give more particulars of by the next opportunity,
by Printing a Specimen of the
Book <em>Ye-kim</em> which explicated by these Notions
will I conceive appear more intelligible,
than by the Accounts we find given of it by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the <em>Chinese</em> Commentators, and those that
have Translated them into <em>Latin</em>, who seem
not to have understood the true design thereof:
For both the <em>Chinese</em> and <em>European</em> Commentators
assert it to be a Conjuring Book,
or a Book to tell Fortunes by, and to be made
use of by the <em>Chinese</em> for that purpose; whereas
by the small Specimen I have seen of it,
I conceive it to contain the whole Ground,
Rule or Grammar, of their Character, Language
and Philosophy, and that by the understanding
of it, the Foundation and Rule of
their Language and Character may be without
much difficulty Deciphered and Understood.</p>

<p>The present use of this Character, I conceive
to be differing from what it was at first,
both as to the position of Writing and Reading
it, and as to the Expression and Pronunciation
thereof.</p>

<p>For the way of Writing and Reading it,
I conceive might at first be exactly the same
with that of the <em>Greeks</em>, <em>Romans</em>, <em>English</em>, and
all other <em>European</em> Nations, and also the <em>Æthiopick</em>
and <em>Coptick</em>. That is, they began at
the top of the Page towards the left Hand,
and so proceeded towards the right in the
<em>Horizontal</em> Line to the end of it, and then
began at the left end of the next Line under
the first and proceeded with that in the same
manner, and so with the next under that
and all the remaining. Continuing to Write
the Words of the Line towards the right
Hand, and the Lines of the Page one under
another till the whole Discourse were compleated,
joyning Leaf to Leaf one under another,
after the same manner as the Rouls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
are at present Writ, and as the <em>Volumina</em>
were of the Ancients. And to make the
parts of the Volume to be the more easily to
be come at, without the trouble of rolling
and unrolling as the Ancient <em>Romans</em> did,
and we do with our Rouls, they contrived to
fold them, like the folds of a Fan, forwards
and backward: And so stitching them together,
that the Written sides might lie outwards,
and open freely one from another,
and the fair sides might meet together, it
came to make the present form of their Book,
which being laid as we generally place our
Books before us, they seem to begin at the
top of the Page on the right Hand, and to
proceed to the bottom, and then at the top of
the next Line towards the left Hand, and descend
as in the former; proceeding in this
order with all the rest, which way must needs
be very inconvenient for Writing, however
they may use their Pencil differing from our
Pen. Though there be a way of Writing
from the top to the bottom of the Page,
which is very convenient for Writing the <em>Syriack</em>,
as also for Writing <em>Latin</em>, <em>English</em>, or
<em>Greek</em>, where the Writing is to be used for
cutting the Stamps of Wood, or graving of
Copper Plates with the same Character for
Printing, in which Cases the Letters must be
written backwards.</p>

<p>Secondly, as to the Pronunciation of this
Character, by the Court Language, or by any
other now used, I conceive it to be wholly
differing from that of a literal Character,
that is from being pronounced or spoken according
to the Marks or Figures thereof,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
whether they be simple or compounded, and
made up of simple Characters (though there
are some Instances of affinity in Characters
and Words.) The reason of which differing
pronunciation I conceive may have proceeded,
partly from the loss of the primitive
Language, for which it was made, partly
from a most inconvenient affection of Monosyllabical
Words in this Court Language, to
help the Poverty of which, they are fain to
make one Syllable to signifie many differing
Notions, to do which they have introduced a
kind of Musical toning or accenting of each of
them, and not single but compound of two or
three Tones to each signification of every one
of these Monosyllables: Partly from the using
of this way of Writing, by divers Nations of
differing Languages, who minding only the
Figure and Signification, read it into their
own Mother Tongues, as we in <em>Europe</em> do
Arithmetical Figures: And partly, also from
the omission of most Grammatical Distinctions,
the same Character serving for Substantive and
Adjective, Singular and Plural, in all Cases,
(save only they have some Characters for Particles,
as <em>of</em> and <em>to</em> in English) for the Verb
in all Tenses, and Numbers, <em>&amp;c.</em> for the abstract
and the concrete Signification, and for
divers Metaphorical; if at least the Interpretation
I have met with in the Books I have perused
be exact: Partly, also from the <em>Syntaxis</em> of
them, it being necessary to consider the whole
Sentence, to discover which part of Speech
each Character is of, in that Sentence, wherein
the Order and Positions of the Characters
to one another, for which they have Rules,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
hath its signification: And lastly, from the loss
of the very Notion of a literal Character,
whence for the expressing of proper Names,
they are fain to make use of several Characters,
whose Sounds or Words come nearest to the
Sounds of the Syllables of that Name, as in
the Plate <em>tam. jo, van</em>, for <em>Adam. Jovan</em>.</p>

<p>Now, though I conceive this Character is
not effable properly as a literal Character by
any of their present Languages: And though
possibly it might be at first a real Character,
that is each of them compounded of such
Strokes or Marks as by their Figures, Positions
and Numbers in the square, denoted the
several Philosophical Ingredients, that made
up the Notion of the whole Character, as the
Book <em>Ye-Kim</em> seems to shew by giving Rules as
I conceive for the Order and Significancy of
places in the Square, <em>&amp;c.</em> Yet I think it not
difficult to make it a Literal, or at least a Syllabical
Character, and legible into a Language somewhat
after the manner of the Universal Character
I mentioned before. And tho' this would
not be the primitive Language for which it was
made, yet for the present uses of it (the chiefest
of which is the assisting and refreshing the Memory,
and helping the Imagination by proper
Sounds) it might be as good: Wherein the
single Characters might be Monosyllables and
the compounded Dissyllables, Trissyllables, <em>&amp;c.</em>
According to the Numbers and Order of simple
Characters in the square of the Compounded.
And I am apt to think that the present
pronunciation of Languages, as of <em>Hebrew</em>, <em>Syriack</em>,
<em>Arabick</em>, <em>Greek</em> and <em>Latin</em>, or any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Language that has been so long Written, may
be as much differing from what it was 2000
Years since, as an Arbitrary one now invented,
and grounded on the Letters, might possibly
be. And such an arbitrary Pronunciation
if generally agreed upon might serve
<em>as well</em> for a help to learn the signification of
Words, or <em>Word Combinations</em> of Characters,
as if we now knew the exact primitive Pronunciations,
as critically as the <em>Masorethæ</em> are
said to have done that of the <em>Hebrew</em>; and
possibly also a <em>much better</em>, for that by such a
one a great many irregularities and difficulties
of Pronunciation (which are to be found in
all Languages now spoken) might be omitted,
and the whole made exactly regular and easie,
as might be shewn in the <em>Hebrew</em> and <em>Greek</em>,
and especially in the <em>Arabick</em>, whose difficulties
are sufficiently manifested by <em>Alphabetum
Arabicum</em>, Printed at <em>Rome</em> 1592. Now as by
such a Language the Character might be made
effable without Musical Tones or difficult Aspirations,
so had we Dictionaries of the signification
of the Characters, we might as soon learn
the <em>Chinese</em> Characters, as we can <em>Latin</em>, or any
other Language to be learn'd by Book, and
not by speaking.</p>

<h2><em>A Letter from <strong>F. A.</strong> Esq; R.

a Paper of Mr. <strong>S. Flowers</strong>, containing
the Exact Draughts of
several unknown Characters, taken
from the Ruins at <strong>Persepolis</strong>.</em></h2>


<p>
<em>SIR</em>,<br />
</p>

<p>I here send you some Fragments of Papers
put into my Hands by a very good Friend,
relating to antique and obscure Inscriptions,
which were retrieved after the Death of Mr.
<em>Flower</em>, Agent in <em>Persia</em> for our <em>East-India</em>
Company, who, while he was a Merchant
at <em>Aleppo</em>, had taken up a Resolution to procure
some Draught or Representation of
the admired Ruins at <em>Chilmenar</em>, pursuant
to the third Enquiry for <em>Persia</em>, mention'd
in the <em>Philosophical Transactions</em>, pag. 420.
<em>viz.</em> <em>Whether there being already good Descriptions
in Words of the Excellent Pictures
and <strong>Basse Relieves</strong> that are about <strong>Persepolis</strong>
at <strong>Chilmenar</strong>, yet none very particular, some
may not be found sufficiently Skilled in those
parts, that might be engaged to make a Draught
of the Place, and the Stories there Pictur'd
and Carved</em>. This Desire of the Royal So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>ciety,
as I believe, it hinted at a Summary
Delineation, which might be perform'd by
a Man qualifi'd in a few Days, taking his
own opportunity for the avoiding much Expence,
(which you know they are never
able to bear:) So I cannot but think Mr.
<em>Flower</em> conceived it to be a Business much
easier to perform than he found it upon the
Place, where he Spent a great deal of Time
and Mony, and dying Suddainly after, left
his Draughts and Papers dispersed in several
Hands, one part whereof you have here,
the rest its hoped may in some Time be
recovered, if Sir <em>John Chardin</em>'s exact and
accurate Publication of the entire Work
do not put a period to all further Curiosity,
which I heartily wish.</p>

</p>

<p>Since I had the Honour of receiving your
last, there came to my Hands several curious
<em>Shells</em> from you, with a piece of <em>English
Agate</em>, and the Transactions of the Royal Society
for the Month of <em>June</em> last, for which
Favours I return my humble Thanks. As to
the Cockles of the <em>Caspian</em> Sea, and from the
Mouth of <em>Wolga</em>, I have advice from <em>Moscou</em>,
that they are expected there this Winter:
Mean while I herewith send you some <em>Snail-Shells</em>,
taken out of the River <em>Jaute</em>, not far
from the City of <em>Moscou</em>. Our Apothecaries
make use of them powdered, and probably
for the same purpose as <em>Crabs-Eyes</em>. There
are some others likewise which are found in
the Rivers of <em>Moscou</em> and <em>Neglina</em>, and in the
<em>Wolga</em>. Since you have been pleased to communicate
to me an Inscription found at <em>Persepolis</em>,
I thought it would be acceptable to
send you the Draughts of part of the Ruins
of the Stone-work of that proud Palace, given
me by the Person himself that drew them
upon the place. I should be much satisfied
had I any thing worthy of your Curiosity and
the Publick, which you so often oblige with
your Discoveries, which justly merit mine
and the Thanks of all that esteem them as

<h2><em>A Description of the Diamond-mines,
as it was presented by the
Right Honourable the Earl
Marshal of <strong>England</strong>, to the <strong>R.
Society</strong>.</em></h2>


<p>The parts of the World known to contain
<em>Diamonds</em>, are the Island <em>Borneo</em>,
and the Continent of <em>India extra &amp; intra Gangem</em>:
<em>Pegu</em> is likewise reported to have several;
but the King not potent, his Country
being but thinly inhabited, contents himself
with his Mines of <em>Rubies</em>, <em>Saphires</em>, <em>Topasses</em>,
<em>Emeralds</em>, <em>Gold</em>, <em>Silver</em>, <em>Brass</em>, <em>Tinn</em> and <em>Lead</em>,
and several other Commodities his Country
affords, in great plenty, rather than to suffer
new enquiries to be made, lest the Discovery
of such an additional Treasure should invite
some of his Neighbours, more potent to invade
him. But leaving the description of
other Places to those that know them better,
I shall only keep my self to the Coast of <em>Coromandel</em>,
with which I am acquainted, and
having visited several of its Mines, am able
to say something thereof Experimentally.</p>

<p>The Diamond-Mines in these parts are
generally adjacent to Rocky-hills, or Mountains,
whereof begins a great Ledge or Range
near <em>Cape Comorin</em>, extending in Breadth
about 50 <em>English</em> Miles, some conjoyning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
others scatter'd: and running thence in length
quite through <em>Bengula</em>. In, among, and near
these Hills, in several places, are known to
be (as its believed most of them have) Mines;
many of them are possessed by petty Princes,
or <em>Rajaes</em>, of the <em>Hundues</em>; some driven thither
for shelter by the <em>Mores</em>, who have taken
the greatest part of their Country from
them; others never overcome, as the <em>Rajaes</em>,
on the Hills in and near <em>Bengala</em>, who admit
of little or no Commerce with their
Neighbours, or passage through their Country,
which (being Barren, in few Places affording
good Water, the ways craggy and
very toilsome, especially to an Army) the
<em>Moors</em> covet not, but let them enjoy it peaceably;
yet to prevent danger, they forbid
digging (as the King of <em>Pegu</em> does) or dig
some few Mines only very privately, so that
a great part of the Mines are unsearcht and
concealed. But the Kingdoms of <em>Golconda</em>
and <em>Visiapore</em> contain in them scope enough
of ground, known to have Mines sufficient
to furnish all the World plentifully with Diamonds;
but their Kings permit digging only
in some Places appointed, lest, as it is
imagined, they should become too common;
and withal for fear of tempting the threatening
greatness of <em>Aurenge Zebe</em>; forbidding also those
Places that afford the largest Stones, or else
keeping workmen in them for their own private
uses: So that but a very small quantity
(in Comparison of what might be) and those
only of ordinary Size, are found.</p>

<p>In the Kingdom of <em>Golconda</em> (as near as I
can gather from the best acquainted) are 23<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Mines now employed, or that have been so
lately, viz. <em>Quolure</em>, <em>Codawillicul</em>, <em>Malabar</em>,
<em>Buttephalem</em>, <em>Ramiah</em>, <em>Gurem</em>, <em>Muttampellee</em>,
<em>Currure</em>, <em>Ganjeeconeta</em>, <em>Luttawaar</em>, <em>Jonagerree</em>,
<em>Pirai</em>, <em>Dugulle</em>, <em>Purwillee</em>, <em>Anuntapelle</em>, <em>Girrogeta</em>,
<em>Maarmood</em>, <em>Wazzergerre</em>, <em>Munnemurg</em>,
<em>Langumboot</em>, <em>Whootoor</em>, <em>Muddemurg</em>, and <em>Melwillee</em>
or the New Mine.</p>

<p><em>Quoloure</em> was the first Mine made use of
in this Kingdom. The Earth is something
Yellowish, not unlike the Colour of our
Gravel dried; but whiter in some Places
where it abounds with smooth Pebbles, much
like some of those that come out of our Gravel-pits
in <em>England</em>. They use to find great
quantities in the Vein, if it may properly
be so called, the Diamonds not lying in
continued Clusters as some imagine, but frequently
so very scattering that sometimes
in the space of ¼ of an Acre of Ground,
digged between two or three fathoms Deep,
there hath been nothing found; especially
in the Mines that afford great Stones, lying
near the superficies of the Earth, and
about three Fathoms deep; deeper they
could not dig for Water; it being in a Vale
near a River. In other places the Earth is
mixt with rugged Stones, where they seldom
mine deeper, though in higher ground,
before the Colour of the Earth alters, and
the Vein ceases; which they give a guess at
by the small Stones they find in the Earth,
the principal Guide they have in the discovery
of the Mines.</p>

<p>The Diamonds found in these Mines are
generally well-shaped, many of them point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>ed,
and of a good lively white Water; but
it also produces some <em>Yellow</em> ones, some <em>Brown</em>,
and of other colours. They are of ordinary
sizes, from about six in a <em>Mangelin</em><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
(of which they find but few) to
five or six <em>Mangelins</em>, each; some
of 10, 15, 20. they find but rarely.
They have frequently a bright
and transparent skin, inclining to
a greenish Colour, though the heart of the
Stone be purely white; but the Veins of these
Mines are almost worn out.</p>

<p>The Mines of <em>Codawillicul</em>, <em>Malabar</em>, and
<em>Buttepallam</em> consist of a reddish Earth, inclining
to an Orange-colour (with which it stains
the Cloaths of the Labourers that work in
it) they dig about four Fathom deep. They
afford Stones generally of an excellent Water
and crystaline Skin; smaller sizes than
those of <em>Quoloure</em>, <em>Ramiah</em>, <em>Gurem</em>, and <em>Muttampelleo</em>;
have a Yellowish Earth, like <em>Quolure</em>;
their Stones like those of the two former
Mines, but mixt with many of a blue
Water. These five Mines being under the
same Government with <em>Melwillee</em>, where the
Governour resides; He to draw the Adventurers
and Merchants near him, that he may
be better informed of the Actions and Advantages,
and know the better how to Fleece
them, the general practice of Governours in
these parts, has very lately forbid their use;
and commanded all to repair to his Residence,
which they must obey, or fly into another
Government.</p>

<p>The next Mine in our way is <em>Currure</em>, the
most famous of them all and most Ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
It has been under Subjection of the King of
<em>Golconda</em>; but about 25 Years, taken, with
the Country of <em>Rarnaticum</em>, from the <em>Hendue-Rajaes</em>,
about that time, by the <em>Nabob</em>, <em>Meer
Jumla</em>. In it have been found Diamonds of
a <em>size</em> weight, which is about 9 Ounces <em>Troy</em>
or 81½ <em>Pago's</em> weight. It is only employed
by the King for his own private use: The
Diamonds that are found in it, are very well
spread, large Stones (it yields few or none
small,) they have generally a bright Skin,
which inclines to a pale Greenish colour, but
within are purely white. The Soil is Reddish
as many of the others.</p>

<p>About sixty or seventy years ago, when it
was under the Government of the <em>Hundues</em>,
and several Persons permitted to adventure
in digging, a <em>Portugeez</em> Gentleman went thither
from <em>Goa</em>, and having spent in Mining
a great sum of Mony to the amounts of 100000
<em>Pago's</em>, as 'tis reported, and converted every
thing he brought with him, that would fetch
any mony, even to what wearing Cloaths he
could spare, while the Miners were at Work
for the last Days expence, he had prepared a
cup of Poison, resolving, if that Night he
found nothing, to drink his last with the conclusion
of his Mony; but in the Evening the
Workmen brought him a very fair spread
Stone of 20 <em>Pago's</em> weight, in commemoration
whereof he caused a great Stone to be erected
in the place, with an Inscription ingraven
on it, in the <em>Hundues</em> or <em>Tellinga</em> Tongue, to
the following effect, which remains to be seen
to this day;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>
<div class="center">

<span class="i0"><em>Your Wife and Children sell, sell what you have,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Spare not your Cloaths, nay, make your self a Slave;</em><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><em>There search the Mines, a Prize you'll find at last.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>After which he immediately returned with
his Stone to <em>Goa</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not far from <em>Currure</em> are the Mines of
<em>Lattawaar</em> and <em>Ganjeconta</em>, which are in the
same Soil as <em>Currure</em>, and afford Stones not
unlike: But <em>Lattawaar</em> hath many representing
the great end of a Razor-blade, thin on
one side and thick on the other, very white
and of an excellent Water; but the best
of the Mine is worn out, and <em>Ganjeconta</em>
employed only to the Kings private
use.</p>

<p><em>Jonagerre</em>, <em>Pirai Dugulle</em>, <em>Purwillee</em> and <em>Anuntapellee</em>,
consist also of Red earth, are now
employed, and afford many large Stones;
part of them of a greenish Water, but the
most absolute Mines are of <em>Wazzergerre</em> and
<em>Munnemurg</em>, (the other rather representing
Pits than Mines;) for there they sink through
high Rocks till they go so far below their basis,
that they can go no further for Water,
in some places 40 or 50 Fathom deep. The
superficies of the Rocks consist of hard, firm,
white Stone, into which they cut a Pit like
a Well, of about 4 or 5, in some places 6
Foot deep, before they come to a crust of a
Mineral Stone, like the Mineral of Iron;
when they fill the Hole with Wood and keep
as hot a Fire as they can there for two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
three Days, till they think it sufficiently heated;
then they pour-in Water till they have
quencht it, which also slacks and mollifies
both Stone and Mineral; both being cold,
they dig again, take out all the crumbled
stuff and dig up what they can besides, before
they heat it anew; the Crust seldom is thicker
than three or four Foot, which ceasing, they
come to a Vein of Earth, that usually runs
under the Rock two or three Furlongs; sometimes
much further: This they dig all out
and search, and if their first attempt prove
successful, they go to Work again (digging
after the same manner) as deep as they can,
till they come to Water; for the drawing
whereof, wanting the help of Engins, known
in <em>Europe</em>, they can go no deeper, although
the Vein lie lower; all lumps of the Mineral
they break in pieces, and frequently find Diamonds
enclosed in them. To Work on
these Mines is very expensive, but the advantage
is commonly answerable; yet in respect
of the certain disburse, that must be before
any thing be found, they are not so much frequented
as others, where they may try their
Fortunes with a smaller Stock. The Earth
they dig out is Red: Many large Stones are
found here; the smallest about 6 in a <em>Mangelleen</em>.
They are mixt Waters, but the
greatest part good, only of ill-favoured shapes,
many cragged pieces of Stones, some as if
they had been parts of very great ones,
others with pieces broken off them; yet I
never heard of any that ever found two
seeming fellows, although they do those that
look as if they had been newly Broken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>In <em>Langumboot</em> they dig as they do at <em>Wazzergerree</em>
and <em>Munnemurg</em>; the Rock is not
altogether so solid, but the Earth and Stones
it produces much alike.</p>

<p><em>Wootoor</em> should have been placed next to
<em>Currure</em>, it lying near it, and affording Stones
of a like magnitude, shapes and waters; 'tis
employed only to the Kings use: And singular,
in that its Diamonds are found in black
Earth.</p>

<p><em>Muddemurg</em> far exceeds all the rest for Diamonds
of a delicate Shape, Water, and
bright transparent Skin, Proud, as it were,
in discovering their inward Beauties, with
which no other Mine can compare; yet it
has also store of Veiny ones, but those likewise
of so curious Shape and Water, that its
difficult to discover them from the good,
especially the small ones. It produces Stones
of divers Magnitudes, from ten and twelve
in a <em>Mangelleen</em>, to six or seven <em>Mangelleens</em>
each, and besides, some great ones. The
Earth is Red, but its seated in the Woods,
and the Water so bad, that to all (except
the People Bred there) it presently occasions
Fevers and destroys abundance, insomuch
that most of the Adventurers have forsaken
it; notwithstanding which it hath been more
profitable than any of the rest, the Vein frequently
lying near the superficies of the Earth,
seldom running deep, and is better furnisht
than any other yet discover'd. The River
<em>Kishna</em>, of excellent waters, is but 9 Miles
distant; but the Miners or Merchants are either
poor that they cannot, or else over-awed
by the Governour, pretend to be and dare not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
be at the charges of fetching their Water
from thence. Divers are of the opinion,
that, besides the Water, the Town lying in
a bottom, environ'd with Hills and Morass
adjoyning, the Air may be infected, and contribute
to its unhealthfulness.</p>

<p><em>Melwillee</em> or the <em>New Mine</em>, so called, because
it was but lately found out (or at least
permitted to be made use of) in the Year
1670. it had then a Year employed the Miners,
but it was forbidden, and lay unoccupied
till 1673, when complaint being made at
<em>Quoleur</em>, that the Vein was worn out, the
King again licensed its settlement. The
Earth they Mine in, is very red, and many
of the Stones found there, have of it sticking
to them, as if it had clung there while
they were of a soft glutinous Substance, and
had not attained their hardness, maintaining
its Colour on its Skin (seeming to be
roughened with it) that it cannot be fetch'd
out by grinding on a rough Stone with Sand,
which they make use of to clean them. The
Stones are generally well-shaped, their size
from 5 or 6 in a <em>mangelleen</em> to those of 14 or
15 each, and some bigger; but greatest quantities
of the middle sorts: Most of them have
a thick dull Skin, incline to a yellowish Water,
not altogether so strong and lively as
of the other Mines; very few of them of a
crystaline Water and Skin. They are reported to
be apt to flaw in splitting, which occasions these
People to esteem them something softer than
the Product of many of the other Mines:
Several that flatter by their seeming whiteness
when rough, discover their deceitfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
having past the Mill, and too often a yellowish
Tincture, to the disappointment and
loss of them that have cut them; but what
they want in goodness, is in part supplied
by the plenty they find, which, together with
their properties, make them the cheaper.
This being what I have gathered, both by
Experience of several of the places I have
seen, and the best Informations I could meet
with, of the Mines in this Kingdom; I shall
now proceed to those in <em>Visiapore</em>.</p>

<p><em>Visiapore</em> is known to contain Mines enclosing
Stones as large and good as those of <em>Golconda</em>;
but the King, for Reasons already
given, makes use but of the meanest: Whereby,
as <em>Golconda</em> is famous for the largeness
of those it affords, <em>Visiapore</em> is noted for the
smallest; whose Mines, though they seldom
or never render an Adventurer a Fortune or
Estate at once, as sometimes those of <em>Golconda</em>
do, by a great Stone or several found
together; yet they are more Populous and
better employed, the small Stones lying
thicker in the Earth, so that the generality
are gainers, and few but they get their Expence;
whereas those of <em>Golconda</em> dig away
a considerable Estate and find nothing, others
not their Charges, and where one is a gainer,
divers lose.</p>

<p>There are 15 Mines employed in the Kingdom
of <em>Visiapore</em>, viz. <em>Ramulconeta</em>, <em>Banugunnapellee</em>,
<em>Pendekull</em>, <em>Moodawarum</em>, <em>Cumerwillee</em>,
<em>Paulkull</em>, <em>Workull</em>, <em>Lungeepoleur</em>, <em>Pootloor</em>, <em>Punchelingull</em>,
<em>Shingarrampent</em>, <em>Tondarpaar</em>, <em>Gundepellee</em>,
<em>Donee</em> and <em>Gazerpellee</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>In <em>Ramulconeta</em> Mines in red Earth, about
15 or 16 Foot deep, they seldom find a Diamond
of a <em>mangelleen</em> weight, but small to
20 or 30 in a <em>mangelleen</em>. They are generally
of an excellent Crystalline Water, have a
bright clear Skin, inclining frequently to a
pale greenish Colour, are well shaped, but
few of them, pointed ones. There are also
found among them several broken pieces of
Diamonds, by the Country People called
<em>Shemboes</em>.</p>

<p>In <em>Banugunnapellee</em>, <em>Pendekull</em>, and <em>Moodawarum</em>,
they dig as at <em>Ramulconeta</em>, and in
the same kind of Earth; they also afford
Stones much alike, being neighbouring Places.</p>

<p><em>Cummerwillee</em>, <em>Paulkull</em>, and <em>Workull</em>, are
not far distant, produce Stones much alike
out of the same coloured Earth, but very
small ones even to a hundred in a <em>mangelleen</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lungepoleur</em> Mines are of a yellowish Earth
(like those of <em>Quoleur</em>,) its Diamonds are
generally well shaped, globular, few pointed,
of a very good Crystalline Water and
bright Skins; many of them have a thick
dark Grass-green Skin, some spotted also
with Black, that they seem all foul, yet are
not so, but within purely white and clean.
Their sizes are from 2 or 3 <em>mangelleens</em> downwards,
but few very small.</p>

<p><em>Pootloor</em> Mines are of reddish Earth, but
afford Stones much like those of <em>Lungepoleur</em>,
only smaller, under a <em>mangelleen</em>; the general
sizes are of ½, ⅓, ¼, ⅙ of a <em>mangelleen</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Punchelingull</em>, <em>Shingarrampent</em>, and <em>Tondarpaar</em>,
are also of red Earth, their Diamonds
not unlike those of <em>Quoleur</em>, only
rarely or never any large ones are found
there.</p>

<p><em>Gundepellee</em> hath the same Earth with
the former, and produces Stones of equal
Magnitude; but frequently of a pure Crystalline
Water, wherein they exceed the
former.</p>

<p><em>Donee</em> and <em>Gazerpellee</em> dig both in red Earth
likewise, and afford Stones alike, the greatest
part whereof are of good Shapes and
Waters. They have also many <em>Shemboes</em>,
and some of bad Waters, some brown, which
these People call soft or weak water'd, being
esteemed of a softer and weaker Body
than others, by reason they have not so much
Life, when cut, and are subject to flaw in
splitting, and on the Mill; their general
Product is in Stones of middle Sizes: But
<em>Gazerpellee</em> has besides many large ones, and
is the only Mine noted for such in the Kingdom
of <em>Visiapore</em>. With which concluding the
description of the Mines, I shall give some
Account how the Diamonds are found, and
how they handle the Earth to find them;
which is as followeth.</p>

<p>The Diamonds are so scatter'd and dispersed
in the Earth, and lie so thin, that in
the most plentiful Mines it's rare to find one
in digging, or till they have prepar'd the
Stuff, and do search purposely for them:
They are also frequently enclos'd in Clods;
and some of those of <em>Melwillee</em>, the New
Mine in the Kingdom of <em>Golconda</em>, have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Earth so fix'd about them, that till they
grind them on a rough Stone with Sand, they
cannot move it sufficiently, to discover they
are Transparent; or, were it not for their
Shapes, to know them from other Stones.
At the first opening of the Mine, the unskilful
Labourers, sometimes to try what
they have found, lay them on a great Stone,
and striking on them with another, to their
costly experience discover they had broken
a Diamond. One I knew who had an excellent
Stone of 8 <em>mangelleens</em>, served so by
ignorant Miners he employed.</p>

<p>Near the Place where they dig, they raise
a Wall with such rugged Stones as they find
at Hand (whereof all the Mines afford
Plenty) of about two Foot high, and six
Foot over, flooring it well with the same;
for the laying of which they have no other
Mortar than the Earth tempered with Water.
To strengthen and make it tight they
throw up a Bank against the side of it: In
one whereof they leave a small vent about
two Inches from the bottom, by which it
empties it self into a little Pit, made in the
Earth to receive small Stones, if by chance
any should run through. The vent being
stopped, they fill the Cistern they have made
with Water, soaking therein as much as
the Earth they dig out of the Mines, as
it can conveniently receive at a time, breaking
the Clods, picking out the great Stones
and stirring it with Shovels, till the Water
is all Muddy, the gravelly stuff falling
to the bottom; then they open the vent,
letting out the foul Water and supplying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
it with clean, till all the Earthly Substance
be wasted away, and none but a
gravelly remains at the bottom. Thus
they continue Washing till about Ten of
the Clock before Noon, when they take
the gravelly Stuff they have washed, and
spread it on a Place made plain and smooth
(like a Bowling-Alley) for the purpose,
near the Cistern, which being soon dried
by the heat of the Sun at that time of
the Day, they very curiously look it over,
that the smallest bit of a Stone can hardly
escape them. They never examin the
Stuff they have wash'd but between the
Hours of Ten and Three, least any
Cloud by interposing, intercept the brisk
Beams of the Sun, which they hold very
necessary to assist them in their search;
the Diamonds, not forbearing to reflect
them when they touch therein, rendring
themselves thereby the more conspicuous.</p>

<p>Some of the expertest Labourers are employed
in searching; he that sets them at
Work usually sitting by, and overlooking;
but it's hardly possible, especially where
many are employed, to watch them so narrowly,
but that they may steal part of what
they find, as many times some of them do,
and, selling it privately, convert to their own
use. If they find a large Stone, they carry
it not presently to their Employer, but keep
on looking, having an Eye on him till
they observe he takes notice of it, when
with a turn of their Hand they give him
a glimpse of it, but deliver it not till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
they have done Work, and then very privately,
it being the general Endeavour to
conceal what they find, least it should
come to the Knowledge of the Governour
of the Place, and he require a share, which
in the Kingdom of <em>Golconda</em> is usually practiced,
without respect to any agreement
made with them.</p>

<p>The Miners, those that employ them,
and the Merchants that buy the Stones
of them, are generally <em>Ethnicks</em>; not a
<em>Musselman</em>, that ever I heard of, followed the
Employment. These Labourers and their
Employers are <em>Tellinga</em>'s, commonly Natives
of or near the Place. The Merchants
are the <em>Banians</em> of <em>Guzzarat</em>, who for
some Generations have forsaken their own
Country to take up the Trade, in which
they have had such Success, that 'tis now
solely engross'd by them; who corresponding
with their Country-men in <em>Surrat</em>, <em>Goa</em>,
<em>Golconda</em>, <em>Visiapore</em>, <em>Agra</em> and <em>Dillee</em>, and
other Places in <em>India</em>, furnish them all with
Diamonds.</p>

<p>The Governors of the Mines are also
Idolaters: In the King of <em>Golconda</em>'s Dominions
a <em>Tellinga Brammee</em> Rents most of
them, whose agreement with the Adventurer
is, that, all the Stones
they find under a<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a><em>Pagoda</em>
Weight, are to be their own;
all of that Weight and above
it to be his, for the King's
Use: But although this Agreement be signed
and sealed unto, he minds not at all
the Performance thereof, but endeavours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>to engross all the Profit to himself, by
Tyrannical squeezing both Merchants and
Miners, whom he not only Taxes very
high, but maintaining Spies among them
of their own People, on the least Inkling
that they have been any ways Fortunate,
he immediately makes a Demand on them,
and raises their Tax; else, on a false Pretence
they have found a great Stone, drubs
them till they Surrender what they have,
to redeem their Bodies from Torment.
Besides, the Excise is so high on all sorts
of Provisions, <em>Beetle</em>, and <em>Tobacco</em>, which to
them is as absolutely necessary as Meat,
or at least in their Esteem, that it is
thereby raised to double that Price they
bear without the Government; and it is
furnish'd only by some Licens'd Persons; if
any other should endeavour to bring in the
least quantity by stealth, he is Fin'd (even
for one Leaf of <em>Tobacco</em>) if it be a Person
of any Repute, or worth any thing,
else very severely drubb'd for it; by which
Course there is hardly a Man worth five
Hundred Pound to be found among them,
most of them dealing by Monies taken
up at Interest of Usurers, who reside
there purposely to furnish them, who, with
the Governor eat up their Gains: So that
one would wonder any of them should
stay, and not betake themselves to Places
where they might have better Usage;
as there are several in other Governments,
and some few that have the Sense
to remove; but many their Debts, others
hopes of a great hit, detains. Both Mer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>chant
and Miner go generally naked, only
a poor Clout about their middle, and
their Shash on their Heads; they dare not
wear a Coat, lest the Governor should
say they have thriven much, are Rich,
and so enlarge his Demands on them.
The Wisest, when they find a great Stone,
conceal it till they have an opportunity,
and then with Wife and Children run all
away into the <em>Visiapore</em> Country, where they
are secure.</p>

<p>The Government in the <em>Visiapore</em> Country
is better, their Agreement observ'd,
Taxes easier, and no such Impositions on
Provisions; the Merchants go handsomly
Clad, among whom are several Persons
of considerable Estates, which they are
permitted to enjoy peaceably, by reason
whereof their Mines are much more Populous
and better employed than those of
<em>Golconda</em>.</p>

<p>It is observable, that notwithstanding
the Agreement with the Adventurers of
the Mines, that all Stones above a certain
Weight shall be for the King's Use; yet
in the Metropolis of either Kingdoms, as
the Cities of <em>Golconda</em> and <em>Visiapore</em> are,
there is no seizure, all Stones are free, and
the late deceased King, <em>Abdull Cutopshaw</em>
of the former, and <em>Edelshaw</em> of the latter,
would not only give very great Prices
for large Stones, but richly Vest,
and present the Merchant that Sold them
with Horses or something else of Value,
thereby encouraging others to bring the
like. But the present King of <em>Visiapore</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
is a Child, and the King of <em>Golconda</em>'s
Delights solely pleased on light Women-Dancers,
and Trick-Showers, that he neither
minds <em>Diamonds</em>, nor many things
more necessary, committing the Government
of his Kingdom to a <em>Tellinga Braminee</em>,
which the <em>Musselmen</em> not well resenting,
does in some measure threaten the
stability of his State.</p>

<h2><em>A Letter from the <strong>East Indies</strong>,
of Mr. <strong>John Marshal</strong> to Dr.
<strong>Coga</strong>, giving an Account of
the Religion, Rites, Notions,
Customs, Manners of the Heathen
Priests commonly called

the Reverend Mr. <strong>Abraham de
la Pryme</strong>.</em></h2>


<p>
<em>Worthy Sir</em>,<br />
</p>

<p>The last time that I had the happiness
to be in your good Company, and
to partake of those Favours and Blessings
that your Goodness was pleased liberally to
bestow upon me and our Companions, at
our departure, and as it were Exile from our
Native Land, does so loudly call out for some
recompence or other at our Hands, that I
cannot without the greatest Ingratitude imaginable,
let slip this (tho' sudden) opportunity
of Writing unto you, and presenting of
you at this time with what I understand you
more value than all the Riches of the East;
to wit, a few Specimens of the Knowledge of
those People whom we stile Barbarians, Heathens
and Idolaters, which I have read in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
their own Books, and gather'd from the
mouths of those that have been the greatest
Speakers and Preachers among them. I have
always had a profound Veneration for the
Dictates of Nature, and the universal Traditions
of Nations, for hereby are Infinite
Things to be learned, for the establishing of
our Glorious Religion against Atheists, and
the more easie propagation of the same among
Infidels and Heathens.</p>

<p>Upon what account or grounds it is that
some Travellers have stiled these People Polytheists,
or Atheists, I cannot tell; or
whether there be any such People at all in
the World, except some of the base common
sort in all Nations, I much question? It is
very observable here, that their Priests, or
<em>Bramines</em>, and Holy Men, whom they call
<em>Jagees</em>, when they have occasion to Write
any thing they always put a figure of one in
the first place, to shew, as they say, that
they acknowledge but one God, whom they
say is <em>Burme</em>, that is, Immaterial. When
they preach to the People, and Instruct them,
which is commonly every Feast-day, full
Moon, or the time of an Eclipse of either
Luminary, they tell the common People much
of God, Heaven and Hell, but very Imperfectly,
Obscurely and Mystically. They
say that when God thought of making the
World, he made it in a minute.</p>

<p>They account this World the Body of
God, for all that they say he's Immaterial;
and say that the Highest Heavens are his
Head, the Fire his Mouth, the Air his Breath
and Breast, the Water his Seed, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Earth and the foundations thereof his Legs
and Feet. But assert in general that God
is the Life of every thing, yet is the thing
neither greater nor less for him.</p>

<p>They hold that God dwelt in a Vacuity
before that he created the World, and that
as he dwelt in that Vacuity he created several
Beings out of himself, the first were
Angels, the second Souls, the third Spirits,
all differing in degrees of Purity, the first
being more pure than the second, and the
second than the third. The Angels, they
say, neither act Good nor Evil, the Souls
either Good or Evil, but the Spirits, or
<em>Dewta's</em>, as they call them, act scarce any
thing but Evil.</p>

<p>They have a good Opinion of the Angels,
and think their State mighty happy,
hoping that when they dye they shall
be made partakers of the same Bliss and
Pleasure.</p>

<p>They believe that every thing that hath
Life hath a Soul, but especially Man; and
they accordingly affirm, that as these Souls
behaved themselves in their pre-existent
State, so are their Actions in this World
either good or bad, by a sort of fatal Necessity,
which is very hard to conquer, or
to overcome. Hence it is, say they, that
there are so many different Humours and
Dispositions of Men, for their Souls, before
their entrance into their Bodies, being
tainted with different Affections, causes the
like differences in the Parties, whose Bodies
are their Vehicles. So that if a Man happen
to have a suddain or unfortunate Death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
they immediately ascribe the same to the
Party's own Wickedness, or the bad Life
that his Soul led before that it enter'd into
his Body. For, say they, the afore-acted
Evil that his Soul did in its other Life,
brought these accidents upon him, by getting
the upper hand of him, and by being too
powerful and strong. And those that dye
thus, they believe that their Souls turn immediately
into Devils. They maintain <em>Pythagoras</em>'s
Transmigration, or <em>Metempsycosis</em>,
but in a grosser sense than he did. For they
believe that Mens Souls, that have not lived
so well as they ought, go as soon as the
Body dyes not only into Birds and Beasts,
but even into the basest Reptiles, Insects
and Plants, where they suffer a strong sort
of purgation, to expiate their former Crimes:
But as for the Souls of the <em>Jogees</em>, or <em>Fuche's</em>,
that is, of Religious Men and Saints,
they fancy that they go and inhabit with
the good <em>Dewta</em>'s, or Angels, among the
Stars.</p>

<p>As for the Spirits, or Inferiour Angels,
they believe that they are very evil, and
have a hand in all Wickednesses, Murders,
Wars, Storms, and Tempests; so that when
they solemnize the Funerals of those that
are dead, they always present Dishes of
Meat, as Offerings unto those Spirits, and
sometimes Sacrifice unto them, that they
may not hurt the Souls of the Dead.</p>

<p>As they acknowledge the being of a mighty
God, so they hold that he created the
World, and every thing therein. They believe
that there are almost infinite num<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>ber
of Worlds, and that God has oftentimes
Annihilated and Re-Created the same. But
how he came first to Create the World and
Mankind, they relate to have been thus&mdash;Once
on a time (say they) as he was set
in Eternity, it came into his mind to make
something, and immediately no sooner had
he thought the same, but that the same
Minute was a perfect Beautiful Woman
present immediately before him, which he
called <em>Adea Suktee</em>, that is, the first Woman:
Then this figure put into his mind
the figure of a Man; which he had no
sooner conceived in his mind, but that
he also started up, and represented himself
before him; this he called <em>Manapuise</em>,
that is, the first Man; then upon a reflection
of these things, he resolv'd further
to create several places for them to abide
in, and accordingly assuming a subtil body,
he Breath'd in a Minute the whole Universe,
and every thing therein, from the
least to the greatest.</p>

<p>They constantly believe that the Universe
cannot possibly last longer than 71
<em>Joog's</em>, which is a measure of time with them,
and is ... years. Which when it is come,
God does not only annihilate the whole
Universe, but even every thing else, as well
Angels, Souls, and Spirits, as Inferiour
Creatures; and then he remains in the same
State that he was in before the Creation;
But say, that after he has a while respired
thus he Breaths again, and every thing is
Created afresh, as well Angels and Souls,
as all other things; but as for the Spirits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
they are no more thought of. Yet for all
this, after 71 <em>Joogs</em> more all is Annihilated
again. How many <em>Joogs</em> are past since the
World was last Created they cannot certainly
tell; only 'tis observable that in an Almanack
of theirs, written in the <em>Sanscript</em>
Language in 1670, they make the World
then 3892771 years old from its last Creation.</p>

<p>The <em>Bramines</em> of <em>Persia</em> tell certain long
Stories of a great Giant that was led into
a most delicate Garden, which upon certain
conditions should be his own for ever.
But one evening in a cool shade, one of the
Wicked <em>Dewta's</em>, or Spirits, came to him,
and tempted him with vast sums of Gold,
and all the most precious Jewels that can be
imagined; but he courageously withstood
that temptation, as not knowing what value
or use they were of: But at length this
wicked <em>Dewta</em> brought to him a fair Woman,
who so charm'd him, that for her sake
he most willingly broke all his Conditions,
and thereupon was turned out.</p>

<p>They tell a great many Stories Absurd and
Ridiculous enough, of the first Ages of this
present World, which would be too tedious
here to take notice of; only I shall here
give you out of one of their own Books
what they tell us of a great Flood that formerly
happened. They say, that about
21000 Years ago the Sea overwhelm'd and
drowned the whole Earth, except one great
Hill, far to the Northwards, called <em>Bindd</em>,
and that there fled thither only one Woman
and seven Men, the names of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
were <em>Dehoolah</em>, <em>Sunnuk</em>, <em>Sunnaud</em>, <em>Trilleek</em>, <em>Sannotah</em>,
<em>Cuppyloshaw</em>, <em>Suraschah</em> and <em>Burroopung</em>; these
understanding out of their Books that such
a Flood would come, and was then actually
coming, prepared against the same, and repaired
thither; to which place also went
two of all sorts of Creatures, Herbs, Trees,
and Grasses, and of every thing that had
Life, to the number in all of 1800000 living
Souls. This Flood (say they) lasted 120
Years, 5 Months and 5 days: After which
time all those Creatures that were thus preserved,
descended down again and replenished
the Earth: But as for the 7 Men and
Women, only one of them came down with
her, and dwelt at the Foot of the Mountain,
the other six turned <em>Fuchee's</em>, or Holy
Men, and spent there the remainder of their
days.</p>

<p>They hold in general the <em>Ptolomaic</em> System
of the Universe, and say that there are 8 or 9
Heavens, counting the Air and Earth, every
one exceeding another in Beauty and Glory.</p>

<p>Their Religion consists of nothing that I
could ever see or learn, but the leading of
a Pure Life, the Washing away of their Sins
in the River <em>Ganges</em>, their muttering over
of divers Prayers, and their doing of strange
and incredible Penances.</p>

<p>They say, that God is such a one, that
whosoever seeks him, let it be after what
manner he pleases, whether by thinking that
the Sun is he, or the Moon, or the like,
if they do it but sincerely and honestly, with
a right affected heart, they shall be received
of him.</p>

<p>They report, that on a time a <em>Mussulman</em>
seeing a <em>Hindoo</em>, or Pagan Priest, in Heaven,
he ask'd God how that Infidel came to have
admittance thither, whom <em>Mahomet</em> so often
calls by the name of Bitter Roots? To
whom God answered, What if a Bitter Root
bring forth sweeter Fruit than any of you,
why should I not receive it? Upon which
the <em>Mussulman</em> had no more to say.</p>

<p>They hold, that such as suffer not their
minds to wander after the lusts of the World
are perfect <em>Jogees</em>, or Saints, and hold that
God is always present with them in all their
actions.</p>

<p>It is to be found in many of their Books,
that there was a time, a good while ago, in
which God took upon him the shape of a
Man, and spent many Years in reforming
the world, and giving better rules to walk
by than had been before: but at length having
left them, they soon forgot him and his
Rules, and returned to their former courses;
upon which he told them that he would
leave them to their ways, and never undertake
any such thing again.</p>

<p>The Religious at some certain Seasons of
the Year come unto the River <em>Ganges</em> (which
they call the Holy River) in vast multitudes,
even from many parts of <em>Tartary</em>, to wash
away their sins, and make expiation for their
faults.</p>

<p>This <em>Ganges</em> is a delicate fine River chiefly
for the sake of its most sweet, pure and clear
Waters, which have got it the greatest
esteem of any River in the East. I have
oftentimes sail'd many Miles up it, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
found it in some places not to be above a
Mile broad, in others not half so much, and
in one or two places not above one eighth
of a Mile. In <em>April</em>, when the Water is at
the lowest, it is almost dry in many places;
but when it is at the highest, which is commonly
about the middle of <em>September</em>, it is
very deep, and many Miles broad.</p>

<p>When the People are here gather'd together,
they have a great many strange
Customs and Ceremonies, and pay a kind of
Divine Honour and Worship to the River,
too long and tedious here to mention. The
<em>Hindoos</em> and <em>Bramines</em> preach then every day
to the people, teaching them their Duties,
and ordering them to say such and such
Prayers; but above all things to be Charitable
to the poor and needy.</p>

<p>It is reported, that upon the Hills by
<em>Casmere</em> there are men that live some hundreds
of Years, and can hold their Breaths,
and lye in Trances for several Years together,
if they be but kept warm; and that every year
some of them come down unto the People
at <em>Ganges</em>, and do many great Cures; for
whom they have such a Veneration, that they
frequently drink the Water they wash their
Sweaty Feet in.</p>

<p>The Penances and Austerities that they
undergo are almost incredible; most of them,
through their continual Fastings, and lying
upon the parching hot Sand in the Heat of
the Sun, are so Lean, Dry'd and Wither'd,
that they look like Skeletons or Shadows,
and one can scarce perceive them to breath,
or feel their Pulse beat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>When any great Man dyes among them,
but especially any of their <em>Jogees</em> or Saints,
they make great preparations for their Funeral;
the Corpse is laid on its Belly, and
Salt and Rice laid round about it at every
corner of the Ground. Then the nearest
Relations to the Party deceased carry a Pot
of Water on their Shoulders several times
about the Funeral Pile, when they burn them,
then breaking it in pieces, spills the Water.
Which Ceremony being ended, the Pile is
fired, and then all the Relations begin to
howl, and embrace one another, then washing
themselves in some Neighbouring River,
they depart every one to his Home; and as
for the remaining Ashes, if he be Rich they
gather them up, and cast them into the
<em>Ganges</em> or the Sea.</p>

<p>Sometimes it happens that the Wife of the
deceased Party, if she have no Children, and
be old, or ill to live in the World, will burn
her self with the dead Body; but this happens
very seldom. It is said, that in such
cases the <em>Bramines</em> give the Woman a stupefying
Liquor, which by the time that they
are in the Fire makes them senseless of any
Pain.</p>

<p>To know into what Body the Soul of the
deceased is transmigrated they do thus; they
strew the Ashes of the Dead upon the Place
where he was first laid after his Death, and
handfuls of odoriferous Flowers about the
same, and returning again in 44 Hours, they
judge by some pretended Impression or other
in the Ashes, into what Body it is gone: If
the Foot of an Horse, or Dog, or Ox, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
such like appear, then they certainly give
out that it is gone into such like Creatures;
but if nothing appear, then they think it is
certainly gone to the Starry Regions.</p>

<p>As for their Learning and Knowledge it is
but little; they have indeed several Books
writ in divers Languages, but they contain
nothing but a great deal of Stuff and Cant about
their Worship, Rites and Ceremonies.</p>

<p>They are ignorant of all parts of the World
but their own; they wonder much at us, that
will take so much Care and Pains, and run
thro' so many Dangers both by Sea and Land,
only, as they say, to uphold and nourish Pride
and Luxury. For, say they, every Country
in the whole World is sufficiently endow'd
by Nature with every thing that is necessary
for the Life of Man, and that therefore
it is madness to seek for, or desire, that
which is needless and unnecessary.</p>

<p>The last time that I was at <em>Modufferpore</em> in
<em>Indostan</em>, I had a great deal of talk with a
<em>Bramine</em> somewhat more Learned than any
of the rest, his Name was <em>Ramnaunt</em>; he told
me a great many Secrets in Physick, and
told me many Traditions and Stories. He
says, that if you bury a piece of Mony for
some considerable time in the Mouth of a live
Frog, and then dig it up again at Midnight,
that this piece of Money, to whomsoever
you give or pay it, will always return to you
again.</p>

<p>He says, that if the little Worm in the
Wood <em>Lukerakera</em> be cut in two, and the one
part stirs and the other not, if the stirring
part be bruised, and given with half a Beetle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
to a Man, the other half to a Woman, this
Charm will keep them from ever lying absent
one from the other.</p>

<p>They have Books full of the like absurdities,
and Cabalistick complication of Figures;
as for Example, if you write these following
Numbers, 28, 35, 2, 7. &mdash;&mdash; 6, 3, 32, 31&mdash;34,
29, 8, 1, &mdash;4, 5, 30, 33. in the squares of a
square Figure, and your Enemies Name under
it, and wear it always about you, your
Enemy shall never be able to hurt you.</p>

<p>So if you write the following Figures in the
like manner upon the left Hand, 2, 9, 2, 7, &mdash;6,
3, 6, 5, &mdash;8, 3, 8, 1&mdash;4, 5, 4, 7&mdash;with Turmerick,
and wash the same off with fair Water
of <em>Ganges</em>, and drink it, it will cure all
manner of Venomous Bitings.</p>

<p>Multitudes of such like ridiculous Fancies
they have; all which they seem to have borrowed
from the <em>Cabala</em> of the <em>Saracens</em>, which
is full of such like.</p>

<p>I lately heard a <em>Bramine</em> say, that if some
of the pieces or knots of the Cloath (in which
a Woman hath been burned with her Husband)
be saved, and made up in the form of
a Wick, and fitted for a Lamp, and lighted,
and set in a dead Womans Skull, that it would
make the dead Party appear. This he said he
had done, but I did not believe him.</p>

<p>When they have any mad Men among them,
they take them and put them into a close
Room, just big enough to hold them, and almost
Smoke them to Death with Musk and
cold Smells, which soon brings their Brains
into their right temperature, and so recover
them, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>There happen'd two things in our Voyage
hither which I thought very observable tho'
perhaps they may not be unknown to you&mdash;The
first was, that all our Tornadoes brought
much Rain with a stink; and if the Seamen
did but lay their Cloaths by for 24 Hours,
they became all full of little Maggots. The
second is, When we came out of <em>Europe</em> we
took in some Water at St. <em>Jago</em>'s, and when
we were almost at our Journeys end, our
Cooper going with a Candle to open one of
the Casks, he had no sooner done it, but the
Water immediatly took Fire, and burnt his
Face, Hands and Fingers; but he suddenly
turning about quench'd the same, by setting
his Britch on it. It stunk pretty much also
at the same time, but afterwards came to its
native Sweetness, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p>
<em>SIR</em>,<br />
</p>

<p>My last to you was from the Island of
<em>Borneo</em>, in which I gave you an account
of our arrival there the 17th of <em>July</em>, where
we staid but two Days, the Season of the
Year being so far past, and from thence made
the best of our way through the Streights
of <em>Banca</em> with favourable Winds and Weather,
till we came on the Coast of <em>China</em> the
13th of <em>August</em>, then we had variable Winds
which carried us abreast of <em>Emuy</em> the 19th
following, at which time the North East
Winds setting in fresh, put us in great fears
of losing our passage; whereupon we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
forced to turn it up against Wind and Current
all the Way, the Weather so favouring
us, that we were never but by our Top-sails,
else we should have lost more Ground
in one Day, than we could have gain'd in
eight. The last of <em>August</em> we came to an
Anchor under the <em>Crocodile</em> Islands, both to
shelter us from the bad Weather, (which
is generally expected on this Coast at new
and full Moon, and has been fatal to a
great many Ships) and also to look for fresh
Water, which was now grown scarce with
us, not having recruited since we came from
the Cape of <em>Good Hope</em>: These are three
small Islands lying in the Latitude of 26
Degrees, about six Leagues from the River
of <em>Hocksieu</em>; on <em>two</em> whereof we found very
good fresh Water, with a convenient Watering-place
on the South West side of the
innermost of the <em>three</em>; and by the assistance
of a few <em>Chinese</em> Fishermen we procured
some fresh Provisions from the main-land,
because we did not reckon it safe to
adventure our selves thither, lest we should
have been brought into Trouble by the
Government there. While we lay here, on
the fifth of <em>September</em> we had a suddain short
shift of the Moonsoon to S. W. the fury
whereof others felt, in coming upon the
Coast of <em>China</em> at the same time. The 8th
of <em>September</em> we put to Sea again, turning
to Windward Night and Day without all
the Islands, which are very numerous along
this Coast, to which we were altogether
strangers beyond <em>Emuy</em>, and the Hydrography
thereof is hitherto so imperfect, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
there was no trusting to our Drafts, which
made our Navigation somewhat more dangerous:
However, on the first of <em>October</em> we got into
the Latitude of 30 Degrees, where we came to
an Anchor near the Land, until we found
the way by Boat to <em>Chusan</em>, about 12 Leagues
within the Islands; from whence we had a
Pilot, who carried us safely thither on the
11th of <em>October</em>. Upon this Island the <em>Chineses</em>
have granted us a Settlement and Liberty
of Trade, but not to <em>Ning-po</em>, which
is 6 or 8 hours sail to the Westward, all the
way among Islands; this being the largest,
is 8 or 9 Leagues in length from East to West,
and 4 or 5 Leagues in breadth; about 3
Leagues from that point of the Main-Land
called Cape <em>Liampo</em> by the <em>Portugueze</em>, but
<em>Khi-tu</em> by the <em>Chinese</em>: At the West End of
this Island is the Harbour very safe and convenient,
where the Ships ride within call of
the Factory, which is built close by the shore
on a low plain Valley, with near 200 Houses
about it for the Benefit of Trade; inhabited
by Men, whose Jealousie has not as yet
permitted them to let their Wives dwell
here; for the Town where they are, is ¾ of a
Mile further from the Shore, enviorn'd with
a fine Stone Wall, about 3 Miles in Circumference,
mounted with 22 square Bastions
placed at irregular distances, besides 4 great
Gates, on which are planted a few old Iron
Guns, seldom or never used: The Houses
within are very meanly built: Here the
<em>Chumpeen</em> or Governour of the Island lives,
and betwixt three and four thousand beggarly
Inhabitants, most part Souldiers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Fishermen; for the Trade of this place being
newly granted, has not as yet brought
any considerable Merchants hither. The
Island in general abounds with all sorts of
Provisions, such as Cows, Buffalo's, Goats,
Deer, Hogs wild and tame, Geese, Ducks
and Hens; Rice, Wheat, Calavances, Cole-worts,
Turnips, Potatoes, Carrots, Beetes
and Spinach; But for Merchandize there's
none but what comes from <em>Ning-po</em>, <em>Hang-cheu</em>,
<em>Nankin</em> and the Inland Towns, some
of which I hope to see, when I have acquir'd
a little of the <em>Chinese</em> Language. Here also
the Tea grows in great plenty on the tops
of the Hills, but it is not in that esteem
with what grows on more Mountainous Islands.
Altho this Island is pretty well stor'd with
People, yet its far from what it was in <em>F.
Martinius</em>'s time, when he describes <em>Cheuxan</em>:
and this puts me in mind, that the Superstitious
Pilgrimages thereto, mention'd by
him, must be meant of the Island <em>Pou-to</em>,
which lies 9 Leagues from hence, and 3 Miles
to the Eastward of this Island, whither (they
say) the Emperour designs in the Month of
<em>May</em> next (being his Birth-day, and the 40th
Year of his Age) to come to worship in an
Ancient Pagoda there, famous for Sanctity;
having sent one of his <em>Bonzes</em> already thither
to get all things in order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>


<p class="right"><em>Chusan</em>, <em>Novemb. 22. 1701.</em></p>

<p>
<em>SIR</em>,<br />
</p>

<p>I formerly told you, that the Emperor design'd
to have come to the Island of <em>Pou-to</em>
(a place of great Devotion) to worship
in the Month of <em>May</em> last, being the 40th
Year of his Age, I should have said of his
Reign; but all things being prepared there
for his Reception, he was dissuaded from his
purpose by some of his <em>Mandarines</em>, who
made him believe that the terrible Thunder
there was very dangerous. This <em>Pou-to</em> is
a small Island about 5 Leagues round at the
East end of this Island, famous for the Superstitious
Pilgrimages made thither for the
space of eleven hundred Years: It's inhabited
only by <em>Bonzes</em>, to the number of 3000,
all of the Sect call'd <em>Hoshang</em>, or unmarried
<em>Bonzes</em>, who live a <em>Pythagorean</em> Life; and
there they have built 400 Pagodes, two
whereof are considerable for their greatness
and finery, being lately covered with green
and yellow Tiles brought from the Emperor's
Palace at <em>Nankin</em>, and inwardly adorn'd
with stately Idols finely grav'd and gilded,
the chief whereof is the Idol <em>Quon-em</em>. To
these two great Pagodes belong two chief
Priests, who govern all the rest. They have
several Ways and Avenues cut through the
Island, some whereof are pav'd with Flag-stones,
and over-shaded with Trees planted
on each side: Their dwellings are the best
I have yet seen in these Parts. All which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
maintain'd by Charitable Devotions; and
the Junks which go from <em>Ning-po</em> and this
place to <em>Japan</em>, touch there both going and
coming, to make their Offerings for their
good Success. There is another Island call'd
<em>Kim-tong</em> 5 Leagues hence in the way to <em>Ning-po</em>,
whither, they say, do retire a great many
<em>Mandarins</em> to live a quiet Life after they
have given over their Employments; on
that Island also are said to be Silver Mines,
but prohibited to be open'd. The rest of
the circumjacent Islands are either desert, or
meanly inhabited by a few fishing People,
but all of them stor'd with abundance of
Deer. For it is not long since this Island of
<em>Chusan</em> began to be Peopled; it's true, in
<em>Martini</em>'s Days, about 50 Years ago, it
was very Populous for the space of three or
four Years, at which time the fury of the
<em>Tartarian</em> Conquest was so great, that they left
it desolate, not sparing so much as the Mulberry
Trees (for then they made a great deal
of raw Silk here) and in this condition it
continued till about 18 Years ago, that the
Walls of the Fort or Town, which now is,
were built by the Governor of <em>Ting-hai</em>, for a
Garrison to expel some Pyrats, who had taken
shelter here. About 14 Years ago, the Island
beginning to be peopled, there was a <em>Chumpeen</em>
or General sent to govern it for three
Years, to whom succeeded the late <em>Chumpeen</em>
(who procur'd the opening of this Port to
Strangers) whose Government continued till
<em>April</em> last, being translated to be <em>Chumpeen</em> of
<em>Tien-cing Wei</em> near to <em>Pekin</em>, and was succeeded
by the present <em>Chumpeen</em>, who is Son to the
Old <em>Chunkoon</em> of <em>Emuy</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>They have got no Arts or Manufactories
here, but making of lacker'd Ware, a particular
Account whereof I cannot as yet send
you. They begin to Plant Mulberry-Trees,
to breed up Worms for the Production of
raw Silk; and they make some Tea, but
chiefly for their own use.</p>

<p>Altho' the following Particulars contain
nothing of extraordinary matters in them,
yet such as they are, you may take, till I can
procure you better.</p>

<p>The three sorts of Tea commonly carry'd
to <em>England</em> are all from the same Plant, only
the Season of the Year, and the Soil, makes
the difference. The <em>Bohee</em> (or <em>Voiii</em>, so call'd
of some Mountains in the Province of <em>Fo-kien</em>,
where it is chiefly made) is the very
first bud gather'd, in the beginning of
<em>March</em>, and dry'd in the Shade. The <em>Bing</em>
Tea is the second growth in <em>April</em>: and <em>Singlo</em>
the last in <em>May</em> and <em>June</em>, both dry'd a little
in <em>Tatches</em> or Pans over the Fire. The Tea
Shrub being an ever-green, is in Flower from
<em>October</em> to <em>January</em>, and the Seed is ripe in
<em>September</em> and <em>October</em> following, so that one
may gather both Flowers and Seed at the
same time; but for one fresh and full Seed,
there are a hundred nought; these make up
the two sorts of <em>Fruit</em> in <em>Le Compte</em>'s description
of Tea: As for his other sort, which
he calls slymic Pease, they were nothing but
the young Buds of the Flowers not yet open.
Its Seed-Vessels are really <em>Tricapsular</em>, each
<em>Capsula</em> containing one Nut or Seed, and altho'
two or one <em>Capsula</em> only comes to Perfection,
yet the Vestiges of the rest may be dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>cerned.
It grows in a dry gravelly Soil, on
the sides of Hills in several places of this
Island, without any Cultivation.</p>

<p><em>Le Compte</em> is mistaken in saying (<em>pag. 96.</em>)
that the <em>Chineses</em> are wholly Strangers to the
Art of Grafting, for I have seen a great many
of his Paradoxical Tallow-Trees ingrafted
here, besides some other Trees. When they
Ingraft, they do not slit the Stock as we do,
but cut a small slice off the outside of the
Stock, to which they apply the Graft (being
cut sloping on one side, agreeable to the slice
cut from the Stock) bringing up the Bark of
the slice upon the outside of the Graft, they
tie altogether, covering with Straw and Mud
as we do.</p>

<p>The Commentator on <em>Magalhen</em> seems
doubtful in the length of the <em>Chinese Che</em> or
Cubit. Here they have two sorts, one of 13<sup>7</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>
<em>English</em> Inches, which the Merchants commonly
use: The other is of eleven Inches,
us'd by Carpenters, and also in Geographical
Measures.</p>

<p>Albeit <em>F. Martini</em> is censur'd by <em>F. Magalhen</em>
for spelling a great many <em>Chinese</em> Words
with <em>ng</em>, which the <em>Portuguese</em> and others have
done with <em>m</em>, yet his way is more agreeable to
the <em>English</em> Pronunciation, only in some Words
the <em>g</em> may be left out, as in <em>Pekin</em>, <em>Nankin</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Having made enquiry about <em>Martini</em>'s Account
of Sowing their Fields at <em>Ven-cheu</em>
with Oyster-shells, to make new ones grow;
I was told that after they have taken out the
Oysters, they sprinkle the Shells with Urine,
then putting them into the Water again, there
grows new Oysters on the foresaid Shells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Martini</em> says he could never find a <em>Latin</em>
Name for the <em>Fula Mogorin</em> of the <em>Portuguese</em>,
I'm sure it's the same with the <em>Syringa Arabica
flore pleno albo in Parkinsone</em>. He says also,
that the <em>Kieu-yeu</em> or Tallow-tree bears a
white Flower like a Cherry-tree; but all that
I have seen here bears a spike of small yellow
Flowers like the <em>julus</em> of a <em>Salix</em>.</p>

<p>The Bean, or <em>Mandarin</em> Broth, so frequently
mentioned in the <em>Dutch</em> Embassy and other
Authors, is only an Emulsion made of the
Seed of <em>Sesamum</em> and hot Water.</p>

<p>Their chief Employments here are Fishing
and Agriculture.</p>

<p>In Fishing, they use several sorts of Nets
and Lines as we do; but because they have
large Banks of Mud in some Places, the Fisherman,
to go more easily thereon, has contriv'd
a small frame about 3 or 4 Foot long,
not much larger than a Hen-trough, elevated
a little at each end, in which he rests upon
one Knee, leaning his Arms on a cross Stick,
rais'd so high as his Breast, and putting out
the other Foot often upon the Mud, he
pushes forward his Frame thereon, and so
carries himself along in it.</p>

<p>As to their Agriculture, all their Fields (where
any thing is planted) whether high or low,
are made into such Plots as may retain the
Water on them when they please. They
Plow up their Ground with one Buffalo or one
Cow. Where they are to Sow Rice, they prepare
the Fields very well, by clearing it of all
manner of Weeds, moistening to a Pulp, and
smoothing it with a Frame drawn across; on
which they Sow the Rice very thick and co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>ver
it only with Water for two or three Inches
high, and when it has grown 6 or 8 Inches
long, they pull it up by the Roots, and transplant
it (by Tufts in a straight line) to
Fields overflown with Water; and where a
Field is subject to Weeds, when the Water
drys up, they prevent their growth in over-turning
the Mud with their Hands in the interstices
where the Rice is planted. When
they Sow Wheat, Barley, Pulse, and other
Grains, they grub up some superficial Earth,
Grass and Roots, and with some Straw they
burn all together; this Earth being sifted
fine, they mix with the Seed, which they
Sow in holes made in a strait Line, and so
grows up in Tufts as the Rice does; the Field
being divided into Beds and harrowed over,
both before and after the Seed is Sown: This
makes them somewhat resemble Gardens. Altho'
they meliorate their Fields, where they
Sow Rice, only by letting the Water on them,
yet for other Grains, where Ground requires it,
they make use of Dung, Human Excrements,
Ashes, <em>&amp;c.</em> In watering their Fields here they
use the same Instrument mention'd by <em>Martini</em>
in the Preface to his Atlas, being all of
Wood, and the contrivance the same with
that of a Chain-Pump.</p>

<p>Their method in making of Salt is this: All
the Shores here being Mud, instead of Sand,
in the Summer Season they pare off the superficial
Earth, which has been overflown with
the Salt Water, and lay it up in heaps for use;
when they are to use it they dry it in the
Sun, rubbing it small; then digging a Pit,
they cover the bottom thereof with Straw, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
which thro' the side of the Pit they pass a hollow
Cane, that leads into a Jar, which stands below
the level of the Pits bottom; they fill
the Pit almost full with the foresaid Earth,
and pour Salt Water thereon, till it be covered
two or three Inches with Water, which
drains through, into the foresaid Jar, and is
afterwards boil'd into Salt.</p>

<p>Had I not found the Printed News Papers
last Year take notice of a singular Root
brought from <em>China</em> by <em>F. Fontaney</em>, I should
not have told you, that I have seen one since
I came here call'd <em>Hu-chu-u</em> (which I take to
be the same) whereto they ascribe wonderful
Properties of prolonging Life, and turning
grey Hairs into black, by drinking its Infusion
for some time, insomuch that they say it's
to be had in value from 10 <em>Tael</em> to 1000 or
2000 a single Root; for the larger it is, the
more is its value and efficacy: Which is too
much Money here to try the Experiment.
You have it mention'd in <em>Cleyer</em>'s <em>Medicina Sinica</em>
No. 84. under the Name of <em>Ho-xcu-u</em>,
according to the <em>Portugal</em> Spelling: It's likewise
painted in the 27th Table of those
Plants Mr. <em>Petiver</em> had of me. If you'll have
the Story of its Discovery, which I will not
warrant for Gospel, it runs thus. Upon a
time a certain Person going a Simpling among
the Mountains, fell by accident into such a
steep Valley that he could by no means get
out of it again; whereupon looking about for
something to sustain his Life; in this melancholy
condition, he espy'd this Root, of which
he made Tryal; and found that in eating
thereof, it serv'd him both for Provisions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
Clothing, by keeping his Body in such a
temperature, that the Injuries of the Weather
had no influence upon him during his
stay there, which was some hundreds of Years;
till at last an Earthquake happen'd in that
place, whereby the Mountains were rent,
and he found a passage out to his House, from
whence he had been so long absent: But the
many alterations that came to pass there in
such a space of time, would not permit them
to give Credit to his Story; till consulting
the Annals of their Family, which gave an
Account of one of them lost at that time,
they were confirm'd in the truth of his Relation.
And so much for this.</p>

<h2><em>A Letter from Mr. <strong>John Clayton</strong>
Rector of <strong>Crofton</strong> at <strong>Wakefield</strong>
in <strong>Yorkshire</strong>, to the Royal
Society, <strong>May 12. 1688.</strong> giving
an Account of several Observables
in <strong>Virginia</strong>, and in
his Voyage thither, more particularly
concerning the Air.</em></h2>


<p>Having oftentimes been urged to give an
Account of <em>Virginia</em>, by several of the
Worthy Members of the Royal Society, I
cannot but, as far forth as I am able, obey
Commands whereby I'm so much honour'd,
and show my Respect by my ready Compliance;
tho' I am so sensible of my own Weakness
and Incapacity to answer your Expectations,
that before-hand I must Apologize for
my self. And indeed by Sea I lost all my
Books, Chymical Instruments, Glasses and
Microscopes, which rendred me uncapable
of making those Remarks and Observations
I had designed, they were all cast away in
Captain <em>Win</em>'s Ship, as they were to follow
me; and <em>Virginia</em> being a Country where one
cannot furnish ones self again with such
things, I was discourag'd from making so diligent
a Scrutiny as otherwise I might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
done, so that I took very few Minutes down
in Writing; and therefore, since I have only
my Memory to rely on, which too has the
Disadvantage of it's own Weakness, and of
the distance of two Years since now I left the
Country, if future Relations shall in some
small Points make out my Mistake, I thought
this requisite to justifie my Candor; for I
ever judg'd it villanous to impose in matters
of Fact; but Descriptions of things that depend
on Memory may be liable to Mistakes,
and yet the sincerity of the Person that delivers
them intire. But hereof I shall be as
cautious as possible, and shall rather wave
some things whereof I have some Doubts, and
am uncapable now of satisfying my self, than
in any sort presume too far. The method I
design is, First, to give an Account of the
Air, and all such Observations as refer thereto;
then of the Water, the Earth and Soil;
the Birds, the Beasts, the Fishes, the Plants,
the Insects; and lastly, the present state of
the Inhabitants: But at present I shall neither
trouble you nor my self with any more
than an Account of what refers to the Air
alone, being conscious the Honourable Society
may receive such a Glut with the Imperfection
of this, as to excuse me from a
farther Relation.</p>

<p>But before I begin, perhaps it may not be
impertinent to acquaint you with some things
that happen'd in our Voyage. We sail'd in
the Ship <em>Judith</em>, Captain <em>Trim</em> Commander,
'twas Fly-boat built, about 200 or 250 Tuns;
she sprung a considerable Leak. When the
Captain had made long and diligent Search,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
had tried all methods that Seamen use upon
such occasions, or he could think of, all in
vain, and that the Leak encreased, he came
pensively to consult me. Discoursing with
him about it, and understanding that the Ship
was Cieled within, so that though the Leak
might possibly be in the fore-part, it would
fill the whole Cavity betwixt the Cieling and
the Planks, and so run into the Hold at all the
Crevices of the Cieling up and down: I thereupon
conceive, that where it burst in betwixt the
Cieling and the Planks, it must needs make some
Noise. He told me, they had endeavoured to find
it out that way, and according to custom had
clapt Cans to their Ears to hear with; but
the working of the Ship, the Tackle and the
Sea made such a Noise, that they could discover
nothing thereby. I happily bethought
my self of the Speaking Trumpet; and having
one which I had contrived for some
other Conveniences, of a differing shape from
the common sorts, I bid him take it and apply
the broad end to the side of the Ship,
the narrow end to his Ear, and it would encrease
his Hearing as much as it augmented
the Voice the other way, and would ward
the Ear too from the confusion of foreign
Noise. Upon the first application, accordingly
they heard it, tho' it happened to be
at a considerable distance; and when they
removed the Trumpet nigher, they heard
it as if it had been the Current of a mighty
River, even so distinctly, as to have Apprehensions
of the bigness and figure of the
Hole that the Water came in at; so that
cutting there the Sealing of the Ship, they
immediately stopt the Leak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Sea I saw many little things which
the Seamen call Carvels; they are like a
Jelly or Starch that is made with a cast
of Blue in it; they Swim like a small Sheep's
Bladder above the Water, downwards there
are long Fibrous Strings, some whereof I
have found near half a yard long. This
I take to be a sort of Sea-Plant, and the
strings its Roots growing in the Sea, as
Duck-weed does in Ponds. It may be reckon'd
among the Potential Cauteries; for
when we were one day becalm'd, getting
some to make Observations thereof, the
sportful People rub'd it on one anothers
Hands and Faces, and where it touch'd it
would make it look very Red, and make
it smart worse than a Nettle. In my return
for <em>England</em> we struck a Hauksbill Turtle,
in whose Guts I found many of these
Carvels; so that it's manifest they feed
thereon. 'Tis commonly asserted by the Seamen,
that they can smell the Pines at <em>Virginia</em>
several Leagues at Sea before they
see Land, but I could receive no Satisfaction
as to this Point; I could not discern
any such thing when at a moderate distance,
I fear much of this may be attributed
to Fancy; for one Day there came three
or four full scent to tell me they were certain
they smelt the Pines; but it afterwards
prov'd that we were at that time 200
Leagues from the Shoar, so that I was satisfied
that was therefore meer Fancy. Indeed
we thought, by the general Accounts
of the Ship, that we had been just on the
Coast, but all were deceived by a Current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
we met with, that at that time set about South-East,
or East South-East, which when once
becalmed we tried thus: We hoised out a
Boat, and took one of the Scuttles that cover'd
one of the Hatches of the Ship, tying
thereto a great Weight, and a strong long
Rope, we let it sink a considerable depth,
and then fastening it to the Boat, it serv'd as
an Anchor, that the Boat could not drive;
then with the Glass and log Line we found
the Current set, as I say, Eastward, at the
rate of a Mile and a half an Hour. This
Current is of mischievous Consequence, it
does not always run one way, but as it sets
sometimes as we proved Easterly, so does it,
as they say, set at other times Westerly,
whereby many Ships have been lost; for then
the Ships being before their Accounts, they
fall in with the Land before they are aware.
Thus one Year many Ships were lost on Cape
<em>Hattarasse</em>, and thereabouts.</p>


<h3><em>Of the AIR.</em></h3>

<p>The Cape called <em>Cape Henry</em>, lies in 36½
of the Northern Latitude. The Air
and Temperature of the Seasons is much govern'd
by Winds in <em>Virginia</em>, both as to Heat
and Cold, Dryness and Moisture, whose Variations
being very notable, I the more lamented
the loss of my Barometers and Thermometers,
for considerable Observations
might be made thereby, there being often
great and suddain Changes. The Nore and
Nore-West are very nitrous and piercing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
cold and clear, or else stormy. The South-East
and South hazy and sultry hot: Their
Winter is a fine clear Air, and dry, which
renders it very pleasant: Their Frosts are
short, but sometimes very sharp, that it will
freeze the Rivers over three Miles broad;
nay, the Secretary of State assured me, it
had frozen clever over <em>Potomack</em> River, over
against his House, where it is near nine
Miles over: I have observed it freezes there
the hardest, when from a moist South East,
on a sudden the Wind passing by the Nore,
a nitrous sharp Nore-West blows; not with
high Gusts, but with a cutting brisk Air;
and those Vails then that seem to be shelter'd
from the Wind, and lie warm, where
the Air is most stagnant and moist, are frozen
the hardest, and seized the soonest, and
there the Fruits are more subject to blast
than where the Air has a free Motion. Snow
falls sometimes in pretty quantity, but rarely
continues there above a Day or two:
Their Spring is about a Month earlier than in
<em>England</em>; in <em>April</em> they have frequent Rains,
sometimes several short and suddain Gusts. <em>May</em>
and <em>June</em> the Heat encreases, and it is much
like our Summer, being mitigated with gentle
Breezes that rise about 9 of the Clock, and decrease
and incline as the Sun rises and falls.
<em>July</em> and <em>August</em> those Breezes cease, and the
Air becomes stagnant, that the Heat is violent
and troublesome. In <em>September</em> the
Weather usually breaks suddenly, and there
falls generally very considerable Rains. When
the Weather breaks many fall Sick, this being
the time of an Endemical Sickness, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Seasonings, Cachexes, Fluxes, Scorbutical
Dropsies, Gripes, or the like, which I have
attributed to this Reason. That by the extraordinary
Heat the ferment of the Blood
being raised too high, and the Tone of the
Stomach relaxed, when the Weather breaks
the Blood palls, and like over-fermented
Liquors is depauperated, or turns eager and
sharp, and there's a crude Digestion, whence
the named Distempers may be supposed to
ensue. And for confirmation, I have observed
the Carminative Seeds, such as warm,
and whose Oil sheaths the acid Humors that
ever result from crude Digestions. But Decoctions
that retain the Tone of the Stomach,
as I suppose, by making the little
Glands in the Tunicles of the Stomach,
squeeze out their Juice, (for what is bitter
may be as well offensive to the Stomach, as
to the Palate) and then Chalibiates that raise
the decayed Ferment, are no bad Practice;
after which, I conceive, Armoniack Spirits
might be very beneficial. But their Doctors
are so Learned, that I never met with any
of them that understood what Armoniack
Spirits were: Two or three of them one
time ran me clear down by consent, that
they were Vomitive, and that they never
used any thing for that purpose but Crocus
Metallorum, which indeed every House
keeps; and if their Finger, as the Saying is,
ake but, they immediatly give three or four
Spoonfuls thereof; if this fail, they give
him a second Dose, then perhaps Purge them
with 15 or 20 Grains of the Rosin of Jalap,
afterwards Sweat them with <em>Venice</em> Treacle,
Powder of Snake-Root, or <em>Gascoin</em>'s Powder;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
and when these fail <em>conclamatum est</em>. But to
return, 'Tis wonderful what influence the
Air has over Mens Bodies, whereof I had
my self sad assurances; for tho' I was in a
very close warm Room, where was a Fire
constantly kept, yet there was not the least
Alteration or Change, whereof I was not
sensible when I was sick of the Gripes, of
which Distemper I may give a farther account
in its proper place. When a very Ingenious
Gentlewoman was visited with the
same Distemper, I had the opportunity of
making very considerable Observations. I
stood at the Window, and could view the
Clouds arise: For there small black fleeting
Clouds will arise, and be swiftly carry'd cross
the whole Element; and as these Clouds
arose, and came nigher, her Torments were
encreased, which were grievous as a labouring
Womans; there was not the least Cloud
but lamentably affected her, and that at a
considerable distance; but by her Shrieks it
seemed more or less, according to the bigness
and nearness of the Clouds. The Thunder
there is attended often with fatal Circumstances:
I was with my Lord <em>Howard</em> of
<em>Effingham</em> the Governour, when they brought
Word that one Dr. <em>A.</em> was killed therewith,
after this manner: He was Smoaking a Pipe
of Tobacco, and looking out at his Window
when he was struck dead, and immediately
became so stiff, that he did not fall,
but stood leaning in the Window, with
the Pipe in his Mouth, in the same posture he
was in when struck: But this I only deliver
as Report, tho' I heard the same Account
from several, without any contradicting it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
These things are remarkable, that it generally
breaks in at the Gable end of the Houses,
and often kills Persons in, or near the
Chimneys range, darting most fiercely down
the Funnel of the Chimney, more especially
if there be a Fire, (I speak here confusedly
of Thunder and Lightning) for when they
do any Mischief, the Crash and Lightning
are at the same Instant, which must be from
the nearness of the Cloud. One time when
the Thunder split the Mast of a Boat at
<em>James</em> Town, I saw it break from the Cloud,
which it divided in two, and seem'd as if it
had shot them immediatly a Mile asunder, to
the Eye: It is dangerous when it Thunders
standing in a narrow Passage, where there's
a thorough Passage, or in a Room betwixt
two Windows; tho' several have been kill'd
in the open Fields. 'Tis incredible to tell
how it will strike large Oaks, shatter and shiver
them, sometimes twisting round a Tree,
sometimes as if it struck the Tree backwards
and forwards. I had noted a fine spreading
Oak in <em>James Town</em> Island, in the Morning I
saw it fair and flourishing, in the Evening I
observed all the Bark of the Body of the
Tree, as if it had been artificially peel'd off;
was orderly spread round the Tree, in a Ring,
whose Semidiameter was four Yards, the
Tree in the Center; all the Body of the
Tree was shaken and split, but its Boughs
had all their Bark on; few Leaves were fallen,
and those on the Boughs as fresh as in
the Morning, but gradually afterwards withered,
as on a Tree that is fallen. I have
seen several vast Oaks and other Timber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
Trees twisted, as if it had been a small Willow
that a Man had twisted with his Hand,
which I could suppose had been done by nothing
but the Thunder. I have been told by
very serious Planters, that 30 or 40 Years
since, when the Country was not so open,
the Thunder was more fierce, and that sometimes
after violent Thunder and Rain, the
Roads would seem to have perfect casts of
Brimstone; and 'tis frequent after much
Thunder and Lightning for the Air to have
a perfect Sulphurious Smell. Durst I offer
my weak Reasons when I write to so great
Masters thereof, I should here consider the
nature of Thunder, and compare it with
some Sulphurious Spirits which I have drawn
from Coals, that I could no way condense,
yet were inflamable; nay, would burn after
they pass'd through Water, and that seemingly
fiercer, if they were not over-power'd
therewith. I have kept of this Spirit a considerable
time in Bladders; and tho' it appeared
as if they were only blown with Air,
yet if I let it forth, and fired it with a Match
or Candle, it would continue burning till all
were spent. It might be worthy Consideration
likewise, whether those frequent Thunders
proceeded from the Air's being more
stagnant, the motion of the Winds being impeded
by the Trees, or whether the motion
of the Winds being obstructed by them below,
the motion might not be more violent
aloft; and how far that may promote inflammability,
for Stacks of Hay or Corn that ferment
with moisture, never burn, unless when
brisk Winds blow, that agitate and fan the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
little fermenting Sparks, and often kindle
them into an actual Fire. And Observance
of the Meteors there might perhaps not be
Impertinent, as both what are more rare,
and what are more frequent, as of <em>Gosimore</em>
in great abundance, and of those small Cob-webs
in a Morning, which some have supposed
to be Meteors. <em>Ignes fatui</em>, tho' there
be many boggy Swamps and Marshes, are
seldom, if any are seen there. There be frequent
little sorts of Whirl-winds, whose Diameter
may be sometimes not past two or
three Yards, sometimes forty, which whisking
round in a Circle, pass along the Earth,
according to the motion of the Cloud, from
whence they issue; and as they pass along
with their gyrous or circular motion, they
carry aloft the dry Leaves into the Air, which
fall again often in places far remote. I have
seen them descend in a calm Sun-shine Day,
as if they had come from the Heavens in
great Showers thereof, so that all the Elements
seem'd filled therewith. And I could
perceive them to descend from on high as far
as I could possibly discern a Leaf. I remember
a roguish Expression of a Seaman, otherwise
silly enough, who wondering thereat,
cry'd out, <em>Sure now 'tis manifest there is a
World above!</em> and now with them 'tis the Fall
of the Leaf. But to proceed, I thought this
made it manifest, whence many preternatural
Showers have happen'd. I remember at
Sir <em>Richard Atherton</em>'s in <em>Lancashire</em>, some few
Years ago, there fell a great number of the
Seeds of Ivy-berries; at first we admir'd what
they were, for they were cover'd with a thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
Skin that was red, and resembled the Figure
of a small Wheat Corn; but afterwards they
fully manifested what they were; for many
sprouted and took Root. I suppose they
were carry'd aloft by some such Whirl-wind,
and let fall there. I have purposely gone into
the place where I perceived this Gust,
which is notorious enough by the Noise it
makes, with rattling the Leaves as it carries
them aloft, and have found a fine sharp
Breeze of Wind.</p>

<h2>Mr. <strong>Clayton</strong>'s second Letter, containing
his farther Observations
on <strong>Virginia</strong>.</h2>


<p>Being honour'd with the Thanks of the
Society for my last, and receiving by
my worthy Friend Dr. <em>Moulin</em> their Commands
to proceed, I have added here my
Observations of the Waters, and part
of the Earth and Soil. I shall wave both
Complements and Apologies, since I have
greater Respect and Honour for the Society
than I can possibly express, and have
no reason to suspect their Favour, whose
Candidness I so signally proved in my
last.</p>


<h3><em>Of the WATER.</em></h3>

<p>'Twixt the two Capes, the Southern, call'd
the <em>Cape Henry</em>, the more Northerly
call'd <em>Cape Charles</em>, there runs up a great Bay,
call'd the Bay of <em>Cheesepeak</em>; nine Leagues
over in some places, in most Seven, lying
much West, Nore and South, dividing <em>Virginia</em>
into two unequal Parts. On the East
side of this Bay there lies a narrow neck of
Land, which makes the Counties of <em>Northamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>ton</em>
and <em>Accomack</em>. On the West side of the
Bay there branches forth four great Rivers,
<em>James River</em>, <em>York River</em>, <em>Rapahanack</em> and <em>Potomack</em>,
that rise from a ridge of Mountains,
whereof more in the Sequel. These Rivers
plentifully water all the other parts of <em>Virginia</em>,
emptying themselves into the great
Bay. The Mouth of <em>James River</em>, which is
the most Southerly of them, the Mouth of
<em>Potomack</em>, which is the most Northerly, may
be a hundred Miles distance: But as I have
been credibly inform'd that the Falls of
<em>James River</em> are not past thirty Miles from
<em>Potomack</em>, which is a vast large River nine
Miles over in many places. I have been told
it was Navigable nigh two hundred Miles,
much higher than any of the other Rivers:
Whence I conclude in future times, it will
be the most considerable for Trade when the
Country comes to be inhabited further up
into the main Land. The other Rivers are
much about three Miles over a piece. And
<em>James River</em> is Navigable at least eighty
Miles. Within four or five Miles of <em>James
Town</em>, <em>James River</em> and <em>York River</em> are not past
four or five Miles asunder. Yea, Sloops of
considerable Carriage may Sail up the Branches
of the two Rivers, till they come within
a Mile the one of the other; for I take it to
be no more from Col. <em>Bollards</em> to Major <em>Troop</em>'s
Landing, and I believe they may come much
what as near again as Col. <em>Coles</em>, and several
other places. <em>York</em> River is distant from <em>Rapahanack</em>
in some places not past ten or
twelve Miles, <em>Rapahanack</em> from <em>Potomack</em> not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
past seven Miles in one place, tho' it may
be sixty in others. The Heads of the Branches
of the Rivers interfere and lock one
within another, which I think is best expressed
after the manner that an <em>Indian</em> explained
himself once to me, when I enquired
how nigh the Rivers of <em>Carolina</em>, <em>Virginia</em> and
<em>Maryland</em> arose out of the Mountains? from
those that ran Westerly on the other side of
the Mountains, he clapt the Fingers of one
Hand 'twixt those of the other, crying, they
meet thus; the Branches of different Rivers
rising not past a hundred Paces distant one
from another: So that no Country in the
World can be more curiously watered. But
this conveniency, that in future times may
make her like the <em>Netherlands</em>, the richest
place in all <em>America</em>, at the present I look
on the greatest Impediment to the advance
of the Country, as it is the greatest Obstacle
to Trade and Commerce. For the great
number of Rivers and the thinness of the
Inhabitants distract and disperse a Trade.
So that all Ships in general gather each their
Loading up and down an hundred Miles distant;
and the best of Trade that can be
driven is only a sort of <em>Scotch</em> Peddling; for
they must carry all sort of Truck that trade
thither, having one Commodity to pass off
another. This (<em>i. e.</em>) the number of Rivers,
is one of the chief Reasons why they have no
Towns; for every one being more sollicitous
for a private Interest and Conveniency,
than for a publick, they will either be for
making forty Towns at once, that is, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
in every Country, or none at all, which is
the Countries Ruin. But to return, The
Tides in these Rivers regularly ebb and flow
about two Foot perpendicular at <em>James Town</em>;
there is there, as they call it, a Tide and
half Tide, that is, it flows near two hours
along by the Shoar, after that it is ebb in
the Channel, and again it ebbs near two
Hours by the Shoar, after that it is Flood
in the Channel. This is great advantage to
the Boats passing up and down the River. I
suppose this is caused by many Creeks and
Branches of the Rivers, which being considerable
many, tho' only three or four Miles
long, yet as broad as the <em>Thames</em> at <em>London</em>;
others ten Miles long, some above twenty,
that have little fresh Water which they carry
of their own, but their Current primarily
depending upon the Flux and Re-flux of
the Sea. So that after the Tide is made in
the Channel, it flows by the Shoar a considerable
time afterwards, being that those
Creeks are still to fill, and therefore as it
were draws up a Source upwards by the Shoar;
and likewise when the Tide returns in the
Channel, the Creeks that could not so readily
disburse their Water, being still to
empty themselves, they make an ebbing by
the Shoar a considerable time after that it is
Flood, as I say, in the Channel. So far as
the Salt Waters reach the Country is deemed
less healthy. In the Freshes they more rarely
are troubled with the Seasonings, and
those Endemical Distempers about <em>September</em>
and <em>October</em>. This being very remarkable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
I refer the Reason to the more piercing Genius
of those most judicious Members of the
Society: And it might perhaps be worthy the
Disquisition of the most Learned to give an
Account of the various alterations and fatal
effects that the Air has on humane Bodies,
especially when impregnated with a Marine
Salt; more peculiarly when such an Air becomes
stagnant: This might perhaps make
several beneficial Discoveries, not only in
relation to those Distempers in <em>America</em>, but
perhaps take in your <em>Kentish</em> Agues, and many
others remarkable enough in our own
Nation. I lately was making some Observations
of this nature, on a Lady of a delicate
Constitution, who living in a clear Air, and
removing towards the Sea-Coast, was lamentably
afflicted therewith, which both my
self and others attributed to this Cause, she
having formerly upon her going to the same,
been seized in the same manner. But to return:
There is one thing more in reference
to this very thing very remarkable in <em>Virginia</em>,
generally twice in the Year, Spring and
Fall, at certain Spring-Tides, the most of
the Cattle will set on gadding, and run, tho'
it be twenty or thirty Miles, to the River
to drink the Salt Water, at which time
there's scarce any stopping of them; which
the People know so well, that if about those
times their Herds are stray'd from their
Plantations, without more sollicitation they
go directly to the Rivers to fetch them home
again. As for the Waters in the Springs in
general, they are, I think, somewhat more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
eager than those in <em>England</em>. In that I have
observed, they require some quantity more
of Malt to make strong Beer than our <em>English</em>
Waters, and will not bear Soap. I have
try'd several by infusing of Galls, and found
little difference in the Colours, turning much
what the Colour of common Sack in Taverns.
I tried two Wells at Col. <em>Birds</em>,
by the Falls of <em>James River</em>, several Wells
near <em>James Town</em>, some Springs in the <em>Isle
of Wight County</em>: There's a Spring in the
<em>Isle of Wight</em>, or <em>Nanzamond County</em>, vents the
greatest Source of Water I ever saw, excepting
<em>Holy-well in Wales</em>, but I had not opportunity
to make Experiments thereof.
I tried likewise some Springs on the Banks
of <em>York River</em>, in <em>New Kent</em> and <em>Gloucester
County</em>, but found them vary very little as
to Colour. I could not try any thing as
to their specifick Gravity, having neither
Aquapoise, nor those other Glasses I had
contrived peculiarly for making such Experiments,
they being all lost with my other
things. I had Glasses blown would hold
about five Ounces, others about ten Ounces,
with Necks so small, that a Drop
would make a considerable Variation; with
these I could make much more critical and
satisfactory Observations as to the specifical
Gravity of Liquors, having critical Scales,
than by any other way yet by me tried. I
used this method to weigh Urines, which
Practice I would recommend to the Inquisitive
and critical Physicians. I had made many
Observations hereof, but all Notes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
likewise lost with my other things. Yet I
have begun afresh; for there are more signal
Variations in the Weights of Urines
than one would at first imagin; and when
the Eye can discover little, but judge two
Urines to be alike, they may be found to
differ very much as to Weight. By Weight
I find Observations may be made of Affections
in the Head, which rarely make any
visible Alterations in the Urine. I
have found two Urines not much unlike
differ two and twenty Grains in the quantity
of about four or five Ounces: But
let them that make these Essays weigh
all their Urines when cold, lest they be
thereby deceiv'd. But to return to the
Spring Waters in <em>Virginia</em>. There's a Spring
at my Lady <em>Berkley's</em>, called <em>Green-Spring</em>,
whereof I have been often told, so very
Cold, that 'tis dangerous drinking thereof
in Summer-time, it having proved of
fatal Consequence to several. I never
tried any thing of what Nature it is
of.</p>

<p>There be many petrifying Waters; and
indeed I believe few of the Waters but
participate of a petrifying Quality, tho'
there be few Pebbles or paving Stones to
be found in all the Country. But I have
found many Sticks with crusty Congelations
round them in the Ruins of
Springs, and Stones figured like Honey-Combs,
with many little Stars as it were
shot in the Holes. And nothing is more
common than petrefy'd Shells, unless you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
would determine that they are parts of
natural Rock shot in those Figures, which
indeed I rather think; but thereof hereafter.
Mr. Secretary <em>Spencer</em> has told me
of some Waters participating much of
<em>Alome</em> or <em>Vitriol</em> towards <em>Potomack</em>. Up
beyond the Falls of <em>Rapahanack</em> I have heard
of Poisonous Waters. But these I only
mention as a hint to further Enquiry of
some others, for I can say nothing of them
my self.</p>

<h2><em>A Continuation of Mr. <strong>John Clayton</strong>'s
Account of <strong>Virginia</strong>.</em></h2>


<h3><em>Of the Earth and Soil.</em></h3>

<p>When you make the Capes of <em>Virginia</em>,
you may observe it low Land, so that
at some distance the Trees appear as if they
grew in the Water; and as you approach
nigher to emerge thence. For a hundred
Miles up into the Country, there are few
Stones to be found, only in some places, Rocks
of Iron Oar appear, which made me expect
to have found many Waters turn Purple
with Galls, but never met with any. Providence
has supplied the common use of
Stones, by making the Roads very good: so
that they ride their Horses without shooing
them; which yet are more rarely beaten on
their Feet, than ours are in <em>England</em>, the
Country and Clime being dry, their Hoofs
are much harder; For I observed, that take
a Horse out of the wet Marshes, and Swamps,
as they there call them, and ride him immediatly,
and he'll quickly be tender-footed.
In some places, for several Miles together,
the Earth is so intermix'd with Oyster-shells,
that there may seem as many Shells
as Earth; and how deep they lie thus inter-mingled,
I think, is not yet known: for at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
broken Banks they discover themselves to be
continued many Yards perpendicular. In several
places these Shells are much closer, and being
petrefied, seem to make a Vein of a
Rock. I have seen in several places, Veins
of these Rocky Shells, three or four Yards
thick, at the foot of a Hill, whose Precipice
might be twenty Yards perpendicular, whose
Delf, I suppose, shot under the Hill, pieces
of these Rocks broken off, lie there, which,
I suppose, may weigh twenty or thirty Tuns a
piece, and are as difficult to be broken as our
Free-stone. Of these Rocks of Oyster-shells that
are not so much petrified, they burn and
make all their Lime; whereof they have
that store, that no Generation will consume.
Whether these were formerly Oysters, which
left by the subsiding Seas, (as some suppose,
that all that Tract of Land, now high
Ground, was once overflowed by the Sea)
were since petrefied, or truly Stones, <em>sui Generis</em>,
I leave to the Honourable Society to
determin. But when I consider the constant
and distinct shooting of several Salts, Nature's
Curiosity, in every thing, so far exceeding
that of Art, that the most Ingenious,
when referr'd thereto, seem only endued
with an Apish fondness, I cannot think
any thing too difficult or wonderful for Nature;
and indeed I do not apprehend, why
it may not be as feasible to suppose them to
have been Rocks, at first shot into those Figures,
as to conceive the Sea to have amass'd
such a vast number of Oyster-shells one upon
another, and afterwards subsiding, should
leave them cover'd with such Mountains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Earth, under which they should petrify: But
not to launch forth too far into those Disputes,
since I must modestly remember to
whom I write. Often, in the looser Banks
of Shells and Earth, are found perfect Teeth
petrefied, some whereof I have seen, could
not be less than two or three Inches long,
and above an Inch broad: Tho' they were
not Maxillary Teeth, the part that one might
suppose grew out of the Jaw, was polish'd,
and black, almost as Jet; the part which
had been fasten'd in the Jaw and Gums, was
brown, and not so shiningly polish'd, or
smooth; if they were, as they seemed to be,
really Teeth, I suppose, they must have been
of Fishes. The back-Bone of a Whale, and
as I remember, they told me of some of the
Ribs, were digg'd out of the side of a Hill,
several Yards deep in the Ground, about
four Miles distant from <em>James Town</em>, and the
River. Mr. <em>Banister</em>, a Gentleman pretty
curious in those things, shew'd me likewise
the Joint of a Whale's back-Bone, and several
Teeth, some whereof, he said, were
found in Hills beyond the Falls of <em>James</em> River,
at least, a hundred and fifty Miles up
into the Country. The Soil in general is
Sandy: I had designed, and I think it might
be worth a critical Remark, to observe, the
difference of Soils seem appropriated to the
several sorts of Tobacco: For there is not
only the two distinct sorts of a sweet-scented,
and Aranoko Tobacco, but of each of
these be several sorts much different, the
Seeds whereof are known by distinct Names,
they having given them the Names of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
Gentlemen most famed for such sort of Tobacco,
as of <em>Prior</em>-seed, <em>&amp;c.</em> Nay, the same
sort of Seed in different Earths, will produce
Tobacco much different, as to goodness.
The richer the Ground, the better it
is for Aranoko Tobacco, whose Scent is not
much minded, their only aim being to have
it specious, large, and to procure it a bright
Kite's Foot colour. Had not my Microscopes,
<em>&amp;c.</em> Tools to grind Glasses, been cast
away, with my other things, I had made
some critical Enquiries into their several Natures,
I would have examin'd what proportions
of Salts, all the sorts of Earths had
afforded, and how Water impregnated with
their Salts, would have changed with infusing
Galls, how with the Syrup of Violets,
and how they would have precipitated Mercury,
or the like, and so far forth as I had
been able, examined them by the several
Tryals of Fire. I conceive Tobacco to be
a Plant abounding with Nitro-Sulphurious
Particles; for the Planters try the goodness
of their Seed, by casting a little thereof into
the Fire; if it be good, it will sparkle
after the manner of Gun-powder: so will the
Stalks of Tobacco-leaves, and perhaps has
something analogous to the Narcotick Sulphur
of <em>Venus</em>, which the Chymists so industriously
labour after. The World knows little of
the efficacy of its Oyl, which has wonderful
Effects in the curing of old inveterate Sores,
and Scrophulous Swellings, and some, otherwise
applied and qualified. The goodness
of Tobacco I look on primarily consists in
the volatility of its Nitre: And hence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
sandy Grounds that are most impregnated
therewith, and whose Nitrous Salt is most
Volatile, for such Grounds are quickliest
spent, yield Tobacco's that have the richest
Scent, and that shortly becomes a pleasant
Smoak; whereas, in Tobacco that grows
on stiff Ground, the Salts seem more fix'd,
and lock'd up in the Oyl, so that whilst new,
'tis very heady and strong, and requires some
time for its Salts to free themselves, and
become Volatile; which it manifests, by its
having an Urinous Smell. The same Reason
satisfies, why Tobacco that grows on low
Lands as far as the Salts, tho' the Plant be
never overflowed with Salt Water, yet the
Ground that feeds the Plant being impregnated
with Salt Water, that Tobacco Smoaks
not pleasantly, and will scarcely keep Fire,
but do all that a Man can, will oft go out,
and gives much trouble in frequent lighting
the Pipe, 'till after it has been kept some
considerable time: Which may be assign'd to
the fixeder Saline Particles of the Marine
Salt in these Plants, which require more
time e'er they be render'd Volatile. Here
it might be worthy an Enquiry into the Nature
of Filtration of Plants, since we may
hence gather, Particles of the Marine Salt
are carried along with the <em>Succus Nutritius</em>
of the Plant; concerning which, if it were
not too much to deviate from the Matter in
hand, I should offer some Reflections of my
own, which the Learned Society might perhaps
improve: For I think thence might
be made many happy Conjectures as to the
Virtues of Plants. So where we see Plants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
or Trees, of an open Pore growing low,
we shall find their Juice has subtile Parts:
So have all Vines, whether the Grape Vine,
or Briony, or a Smilax, or the like. If a
Gummous Plant or Tree, that grows low,
and close Pored, it abounds with acid Spirits,
as <em>Lignum Vitæ</em>, &amp;c. if it grow tall, and
be open Pored, it abounds with a subtile
Volatile Spirit, as your Firs, and the Turpentine
Tree. But to insist no further herein,
than as this may be applicable to the
present Discourse: For I have observed, that
that which is called Pine-wood Land, tho'
it be a sandy Soil, even the Sweet-scented
Tobacco that grows thereon, being large
and porous, agreeable to Aranoko Tobacco;
it smoaks as coarsely as Aranoko: Wherefore
'tis, that I believe the Microscope might
make notable Discoveries towards the knowledge
of good Tobacco: For the closer the Composition
of the Leaf, the better the Tobacco;
and therefore the Planters and Merchants
brag of the Substance of their Tobacco;
which word, did they always take it in a
true Sence, for the Solidness, and not mistake
it for the Thickness, it would be more consonant
to a true Observation: for as I said
of the Pine-wood Tobacco, some of it is
thick and not Solid, and differs from the
best Tobacco, as Buff does from Tann'd
Leather; so that if the Tobacco be sound
and not Rotten, you may give a great guess
at the goodness of Tobacco, when you weigh
the Hogsheads, before you see them: For if
an equal care be taken in the packing of them
the best Tobacco will weigh the heaviest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
and Pack the closest. Now I said, that the
Sweet-scented Tobacco most in vogue, which
was most fam'd for its Scent, was that that
grew on sandy Land; which is true, if you
would Smoak it whilst new, or whilst only
two or three Years Old; but if you keep
the stiff Land Tobacco, which is generally a
Tobacco of great Substance five or six Years,
it will much excel: For tho' the sandy Land
Tobacco abound with a Volatile Nitre at
first, yet the stiff Land Tobacco abounds
with a greater quantity of Nitre, only that
it is lock'd up in its Oyl at first, and requires
more time to extricate it self, and become
Volatile; but the Pine-wood Land having
little of the Nitro-Sulphurious Particles,
neither is, nor ever will make any thing of
a rich Smoak. Discoursing hereof some days
since, to a Gentleman of good Observation,
that has been versed with Malting, he assured
me, to back this my Supposition, or
Hypothesis, he had observed, that Barly that
grew on stiff Ground, requir'd more time
considerably to Mellow, and come to perfection,
than that that grew on light Land.
Having proceeded thus far to speak of Tobacco,
I shall add one or two things more.
The Planters differ in their Judgments about
the Time of Planting, or Pitching their
Crops: Some are for Pitching their Crops
very early, others late, without any distinction
of the Nature of the Soils; and 'tis from
the different Effects that they find, in that,
sometimes early, sometimes the late Planting
succeeds: But they have not the Reason to
judge of the Cause, to consider the Accidents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
of the Year, and the Difference of the Soils.
In sandy Grounds they need not strive so
much for early Planting, the Looseness of
the Earth, and the kind natur'd Soil, yielding
all that it can, easily and speedily, and
Sand retaining the Heat, makes the Plants
grow faster. But in stiff Soils, if the Crops
be not early pitch'd, so that during the
Season of Rains it have got considerable
Roots, and shot them some depth, if early
Droughts come, it so binds the Land, that
the Roots never spread or shoot deeper, or
further than the Hill that they are planted
in: For they plant them as we do Cabbages,
raising Hills to set every Plant in, about the
bigness of a common Mole-hill: observing
this on the Plantation where I lived, that
it was stiff Ground, I advised them to Plant
their Crops as early as possible; and in order
thereunto, I tried several ways to further
the Plants; but not to trouble you with
the several Experiments that I made, in reference
thereto: What I found most advantageous
was, by taking an infusion of Horse-dung,
and putting thereon Soot, and then
my Seeds; this I kept Forty eight Hours in
an ordinary digestive heat, I had two Beds
left me to Sow, in the midst of those the
People sow'd, and the quantity of Seed
that they generally allotted to the same quantity
of Ground; when I sow'd, I mix'd Ashes
with the Seed, having decanted the Liquor,
that the Seed might sow the evener: The
effect was, that my Plants came up much
sooner, grew swifter, and I had five Plants
for one more than any of the other Beds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
bore; I left the Country shortly after, and so
no certainty of the final Result. There be had
various Accidents and Distempers, whereunto
Tobacco is liable, as the Worm, the Fly,
Firing to Turn, as they call them, French-men,
and the like. I propos'd several ways
to kill the Worm and Fly, as by Sulphur
and the like; but had no opportunity to
experiment it: I shall set down that I had
most hopes of, which perhaps may give a
hint to others to try or improve. Tobacco-seed
is very small, and by consequence so is
the young Plant at first, that if gleamy Weather
happen at that time, it breeds a small
Fly, which consumes the Plume of the Plant;
now it being early in the Year when they
Sow the Seed, <em>viz.</em> about the fourteenth of
<em>January</em>, they cover the Ground, to secure,
as well as they can, their tender Plants, from
the nipping Frosts, that may happen in the
Nights; they cover them only with a few
Oak-leaves, or the like; for Straw they find
apt to Harbour and Breed this Fly: I therefore
would advise them to smoak Straw with
Brimstone, once in two or three Nights, and
so they might cover them securely, with that
which would preserve them infinitely beyond
the Covering with Oak-boughs; indeed, I
would advise them to keep peculiarly so much
of their <em>Indian</em> Corn-blades, which they gather
for their Fodder, for this very purpose,
being as I conceive, much the best, there being
no Chaff to foul their Beds, and prejudice
them when they should weed them.
What they call Firing is this: When Plants
are of small Substance, as when there has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
been a very Wet and Cold Season, and very
hot Weather suddainly ensues, the Leaves
turn Brown, and dry to dust: the cause I
conceive to be hence: The Plant being feeble,
and having a small quantity of Oyl,
which makes the more solid part of the
Plant, the Earth being suddainly heated by the
Sun's fiercer Beams, the Roots are rather
scorch'd and dried up in the Earth, than
nourish'd; so that the Plant consisting only
of watry parts, is consumed, as it were, by
Fire: sometimes hopeful Plants, when by a
sudden Gust some Master Veins are broken,
if suddain heat ensues, they likewise Fire:
For being not come to maturity, and being
deprived of the Supports of Life and Vegetation,
they likewise perish, are dried up,
and fall to dust. <em>French-men</em> they call those
Plants, whose leaves do not spread and grow
large, but rather spire upwards, and grow
tall; these Plants they do not tend, being
not worthy their Labour. Were they so
Critical, I believe, they might have great
Guess what Plants were most likely to turn
<em>French-men</em>, by observing whether the Roots
of the Plants run downwards, as those whose
Branches are aptest to spire upwards: For
tho' I have not made positive proof thereof,
I have something more than bare fancy for
my conjecture; I have pull'd up some of
these <em>French-men</em>, and compar'd them with
the Roots of some other Plants, and found
them much longer than others; and 'tis
observable, loose Soils, and sandy Ground,
are more subject thereto than the stiff Land.
The Country of it self is one entire Wood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
consisting of large Timber Trees of several
sorts, free from Thickets or under Wood,
the small Shrubs growing only on Lands,
that have been clear'd, or in Swamps;
and thus it is for several Hundreds of
Miles, even as far as has yet been discover'd.
But that shall be reserv'd 'till another opportunity.</p>

<h2><em>Mr. <strong>John Clayton</strong>, Rector of
<strong>Crofton</strong> at <strong>Wakefield</strong>, his Letter
to the <strong>Royal Society</strong>, giving
a farther Account of the Soil,
and other Observables of <strong>Virginia</strong>.</em></h2>


<p>I shall here present you with a continuation
of my Remarks on the River, Soil,
and Plants of <em>Virginia</em>. And first, as to
the River on the other side the Mountains,
said to Ebb and Flow. I have been assured
by Col. <em>Bird</em>, who is one of the Intelligentest
Gentlemen in all <em>Virginia</em>, and knows
more of <em>Indian</em> Affairs than any Man in
the Country, that it was a Mistake; for
that it must run into a Lake, now called
<em>Lake Petite</em>, which is fresh Water; for since
that time a Colony of the <em>French</em> are come
down from <em>Canada</em>, and have seated themselves
on the back of <em>Virginia</em>, where <em>Fallam</em>
and the rest suppos'd there might be
a Bay, but is a Lake, to which they
have given the Name of <em>Lake Petite</em>, there
being several larger Lakes 'twixt that and
<em>Canada</em>. The <em>French</em> possessing themselves of
these Lakes, no doubt will in short time be
absolute Masters of the Beaver Trade, the
greatest number of Beavers being catch'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
there. The Colonel told me likewise, that
the common Notion of the Lake of <em>Canada</em>,
he was assured was a Mistake, for the River
supposed to come out of it, had no Communication
with any of the Lakes, nor the
Lakes one with another, but were distinct.
But not to ramble after hear-say, and other
matters; but to return to the Parts of
<em>Virginia</em> inhabited by the <em>English</em>, which in
general is a very Fertile Soil, far surpassing
<em>England</em>, for there <em>English</em> Wheat (as they
call it, to distinguish it from <em>Maze</em>, commonly
called <em>Virginia</em> Wheat) yields generally
'twixt Fifteen and Thirty fold, the
Ground only once plow'd; whereas 'tis a
good Crop in <em>England</em> that yields above
Eight fold, after all their Toil and Labour.
And yet in truth 'tis only the barrennest
Parts that they have cultivated, Tilling
and Planting only the High-Lands,
leaving the Richer Vales unstirr'd, because
they understand not any thing of Draining.
So that the Richest Meadow-Lands, which
is one third of the Country, is Boggy,
Marsh, and Swamp, whereof they make
little Advantage, but loose in them abundance
of their Cattle, especially at the first
of the Spring, when the Cattle are weak,
and venture too far after young Grass.
Whereas vast Improvements might be made
thereof; for the generality of <em>Virginia</em> is a
Sandy Land with a shallow Soil. So that after
they have cleared a fresh piece of Ground
out of the Woods, it will not bear Tobacco
past two or three Years, unless Cow-pen'd;
for they Manure their Ground by keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
their Cattle, as in the South you do your
Sheep, every Night confining them within
Hurdles, which they remove when they have
sufficiently dung'd one spot of Ground; but
alas! they cannot Improve much thus, besides
it produces a strong sort of Tobacco,
in which the Smoakers say they can plainly
taste the fulsomeness of the Dung. Therefore
every three or four Years they must be
for clearing a new piece of Ground out of
Woods, which requires much Labour and
Toil, it being so thick grown all over with
Massy Timber. Thus their Plantations run
over vast Tracts of Ground, each ambitioning
to engross as much as they can, that
they may be sure to have enough to Plant,
and for their Stocks and Herds of Cattel
to Range and Feed in, that Plantations of
1000, 2000, or 3000 Acres are common,
whereby the Country is thinly inhabited;
their Living solitary and unsociable; Trading
confused and dispersed; besides other Inconveniences:
Whereas they might Improve 200
or 300 Acres to more Advantage, and would
make the Country much more Healthy; for
those that have 3000 Acres, have scarce
cleared 600 Acres thereof, which is peculiarly
term'd the Plantation, being surrounded
with the 2400 Acres of Woods: so that there
can be no free or even motion of the Air,
but the Air is kept either stagnant, or the
lofty Sulphurous Particles of the Air, that
are higher than the tops of the Trees, which
are above as high again as the generality of
the Woods in <em>England</em>, descending when
they pass over the cleared spots of Ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
must needs in the violent heat of Summer,
raise a preternatural Ferment, and produce
bad Effects. Nor is it any advantage to
their Stocks, or Crops; for did they but
drain their Swamps, and Low-Lands, they
have a very deep Soil, that would endure
Planting twenty or thirty Years, and some
would scarce ever be worn out, but be ever
longer better, for they might lay them all
Winter, or when they Pleased in Water,
and the product of their Labour would be
double or treble, whether Corn or Tobacco;
and that this is no fond Projection, (though
when I have discoursed the same to several,
and in part shewn them how their particular
Grounds might be drained at a very
easie rate) they have either been so conceited
of their old way, so sottish as not to apprehend,
or so negligent as not to apply themselves
thereto. But on the Plantation where
I lived, I drained a good large Swamp, which
fully answered expectation. The Gentlewoman
where I lived, was a very Acute Ingenious
Lady; who one day Discoursing the
Overseer of her Servants, about pitching
the ensuing Year's Crop. The Overseer was
naming one place where he designed to Plant
30000 Plants, another place for 15000, another
for 10000, and so forth the whole Crop,
designed to be about 100000 Plants: Having
observed the Year before he had done the
like, and scattered his Crop up and down
the Plantation, at Places a Mile, or a Mile
and a half asunder, which was very Inconvenient,
and whereby they lost much time.
I interposed, and asked, why they did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
Plant all their Crop together? The Fellow
smiled as it were at my Ignorance, and said,
there was very good Reason for it. I replied,
that was it I enquir'd after. He returned,
the Plantation had been an old planted Plantation,
and being but a small Plot of Ground,
was almost worn out, so that they had not
Ground altogether that would bring forth
Tobacco. I told him then they had better
Ground than ever yet they had planted, and
more than their Hands could manage. He
smil'd again, and asked me, where? I then
named such a Swamp. He then said scornfully,
he thought what a Planter I was; that
I understood better how to make a Sermon,
then managing Tobacco. I replied with
some warmness, tho' I hoped so, that was
Impertinence, and no Answer. He then said,
that the Tobacco there would drown, and
the Roots rot. I replied, that the whole
Country would drown if the Rivers were
stopt, but it might be laid as dry as any
Land on the Plantation. In short, we discoursed
it very warmly, till he told me, he
understood his own Business well enough,
and did not desire to learn of me. But the
Gentlewoman attended somewhat better to
my Reasoning, and got me one day to go
and shew her how I projected the draining
of the Swamp, and thought it so feasible,
that she was resolved to have it done; and
therefore desir'd me I would again Discourse
her Overseer, which I did several times, but
he would by no means hearken thereto, and
was so positive, that she was forc'd to turn
him away, to have her Servants set about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
the Work; and with three Men in thirteen
Days I drained the whole Swamp, it being
Sandy Land, soaks and drains admirably well,
and what I little expected, laid a Well dry
at a considerable distance. The Gentlewoman
was in <em>England</em> last Year, and I think
Dr. <em>Moulin</em> was by when she asked me. Now
to teach her how she might make her Tobacco
that grew in the Swamp less, for it produced
so very large, that it was suspected to
be of the <em>Aranoko</em> kind: I told her, though
the complaint was rare, yet there was an
Excellent Remedy for that, in letting every
Plant bear eight or nine Leaves instead of
four or five, and she would have more Tobacco,
and less Leaves. Now you must know
they top their Tobacco, that is, take away
the little top-bud, when the Plant has put
forth as many Leaves as they think the
Richness of the Ground will bring to a Substance;
but generally when it has shot forth
four or six Leaves. And when the top-bud
is gone, it puts forth no more Leaves, but
Side-branches, which they call Suckers, which
they are careful ever to take away, that
they may not empoverish the Leaves. I
have been more tedious in the Particulars,
the fullier to evince how resolute they are
and conceitedly bent to follow their old
Practice and Custom, rather than to receive
Directions from others, tho' plain, easie,
and advantageous. There are many other
Places as easie to drain as this, tho' of
larger extent, and richer Soil, for some of
which I have given directions, and have only
had the return perhaps of a flout after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>wards:
Even in <em>James Town Island</em>, which is
much what of an Oval Figure, there's a Swamp
runs Diagonal-wise over the Island, whereby
is lost at least 150 Acres of Land, which would
be Meadow, which would turn to as good Account
as if it were in <em>England</em>: Besides it is the
great annoyance of the Town, and no doubt but
makes it much more unhealthy. If therefore they
but scour'd the Channel, and made a pretty
ordinary Trench all along the middle of the
Swamp, plac'd a Sluice at the Mouth, where
it opens into the back Creek; for the Mouth
of the Channel there is narrow, has a good
hard bottom, and is not past two Yards deep
when the Flood is out; as if Nature had designed
it before hand: They might thus drain
all the Swamp absolutely dry, or lay it under
Water at their Pleasure. I have talked several
times hereof to Mr. <em>Sherwood</em>, the owner
of the Swamp, yet nothing is essayed in Order
thereto. And now since we are speaking
of <em>James Town</em> give me leave to adjoin some
Reflections as to the Situation and Fortifications
of the Place. The Natural Situation
of the place is such, as perhaps the World
has not a more commodious Place for a Town,
where all things conspire for Advantage thereof.</p>

<p><em>James Town Island</em> is rather a <em>Peninsula</em>, being
joined to the Continent by a small Neck
of Land, not past Twenty or Thirty Yards
over, and which at Spring-Tides is overflow'd,
and is then an absolute Island. Now they
have built a silly sort of a Fort, that is, a
Brick Wall in the shape of a Half-Moon, at
the beginning of the Swamp, because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
Channel of the River lies very nigh the
Shoar; but it is the same as if a Fort were
built at <em>Chelsey</em> to secure <em>London</em> from being
taken by Shipping. Besides Ships passing up
the River are secured from the Guns of the
Fort, till they come directly over-against the
Fort, by reason the Fort stands in a Vale,
and all the Guns directed down the River,
that should play on the Ships, as they are
coming up the River, will lodge their Shot
within Ten, Twenty, or Forty Yards in the
rising Bank, which is much above the Level
of the Fort; so that if a Ship gave but a
good Broad-side, just when she comes to bear
upon the Fort, she might put the Fort into
that confusion, as to have free Passage enough.
There was indeed an old Fort of Earth in
the Town, being a sort of <em>Tetragone</em>, with
something like Bastions at the four Corners,
as I remember; but the Channel lying further
off to the middle of the River there,
they let it be demolished, and built that
new one spoke of, of Brick, which seems little
better than a blind Wall, to shoot Wild
Ducks or Geese.</p>

<p>If they would build a Fort for the Security
of the Town and Country, I conceive it should
be on <em>Archer</em>'s <em>Hope Point</em>, for that would stop
the Ships from passing up the River, before
they came to the Town, and would secure
the Town from being block'd up by Sea.
The Channel at <em>Archer</em>'s <em>Hope Point</em> lies close
by the Shoar, and makes such an Angle there
by reason of <em>Hog Island</em>, that going up or
down the River, let the Wind be where it
will, they must there bring the contrary Tack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
on Board, and generally when they About
the Ship as they call it, they are so near
the Shoar, that a Man may almost fling a
Finger-stone on Board. How much this
hinders the motion of a Ship, and what
Confusion it must be to them to bring a contrary
Tack on Board, whilst they have all
the Guns of a Fort playing so nigh upon
them, may readily be conceived. <em>Archer</em>'s
<em>Hope</em> is a Neck of Land, that runs down
three Miles long, not much past half a Mile
broad betwixt the Main River and <em>Archer</em>'s
<em>Hope Creek</em>, which has large Marshes and
Swamps; so that a Citadel built upon the
Point, would almost be Impregnable, being
it could be attack'd no way but one, which
is so narrow a slender Neck of Land, that
it would be difficult to take it that way:
And it would secure <em>James Town</em> from being
block'd, being it would not be past a Mile
by Water, to the Point of <em>James Town Island</em>.
The Island is so surrounded with Water and
Marshy Land, that the Town could never
be Bomb'd by Land. But now to return to
the Reflections of Improving, and Manuring
of Land in <em>Virginia</em>; hitherto, as I have
said, they have used none but that of Cow-penning;
yet I suppose they might find very
good Marle in many places, I have seen both
the red and blew Marle at some breaks of
Hills: This would be the properest Manure
for their Sandy Land, if they spread it not
too thick, theirs being, as I have said, a
shallow, Sandy Soil, which was the Reason
I never advised any to use Lime, tho' they
have very good Lime of Oyster-shells; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
that's the properest Manure for cold Clay
Land, and not for a Sandy Soil. But as most
Lands have one Swamp or another bordering
on them, they may certainly get admirable
Slitch, wherewith to Manure all their uplands.
But this, say they, will not improve
Ground, but clods and grows hard; 'tis
true, it will do so for some time, a Year or
two at the first; but did they cast it in heaps,
and let it lie for two or three Years after a
Frost or two had seized it, and it had been
well pierced therewith, I doubt not it would
turn to good Account: And for this too I
have something more than bare conjecture;
for Discoursing it once with a good notable
Planter, we went to view a heap thereof,
that casually he had cast up 'twixt three and
four Years before, and we found it not very
binding, but rather a fine Natural Mold,
whereupon he did confess, he then remembred
that out of a ridge of the like Mold
he had very large Plants, which must have
been of the like Slime or Slitch cast up before:
But said, that himself and others despaired
of this Manure, because they had
taken of this Slitch fresh and moist out of
the Swamp, and fill'd Tobacco Hills with it,
and in the midst of it planted their Plants,
which so bound the Roots of their Plants,
that they never came to any thing. But he
said, he then saw his Error, yet I have not
heard he has remembred to Correct it. But
'tis strange in how many things besides they
are remiss, which one would think <em>English</em>
Men should not be guilty of. They neither
House nor Milk any of their Cows in Win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>ter,
having a Notion that it would kill them;
yet I perswaded the afore-mentioned Lady
where I lived, to Milk four Cows the last
Winter that I staid in the Country, whereof
she found so good Effect, that she assured
me she would keep to my Advice for the future;
and also as I had further urged, House
them too, for which they have mighty Conveniencies,
their Tobacco Houses being empty
ever at that time of the Year, and may
easily be fitted in two or three days time
without any Prejudice; whereby their Cattle
would be much sheltered from those Pinching
sharp Frosts that some Nights on a sudden
become very severe. I had another Project
for the Preservation of their Cattle
proved very successful; I urged the Lady to
sow her Wheat as early as possibly she could,
so that before Winter it might be well rooted,
to be early and flourishing at the first
of the Spring: So that she might turn thereon
her weak Cattle, and such as should at
any time be swamp'd, whereby they might
be recruited and saved, and it would do the
Wheat good also. I advised her likewise to
save, and carefully gather her <em>Indian</em> Corn-tops,
and blades, and all her Straw, whatever
could be made Fodder, for her Cattle;
for they get no Hay, tho' I was urging her
to that too, and to sow <em>Saintfoin</em>; for being
a Sandy Soil, I am confident it would
turn to very good Account. They have little
or no Grass in Winter, so that their
Cattle are pined and starved, and many
that are brought low and weak, when the
Spring begins, venture too far into the Swamps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
after the fresh Grass, where they perish; so
that several Persons lose ten, twenty or thirty
Head of Cattle in a Year: I observed this
was much owing to their Inadvertency and
Error in their way of Managing and Feeding
them; for they get little Fodder, but as they
think Corn being more Nourishing, feed them
with their <em>Indian</em> Corn, which they give them
Morning and Evening; they spend thus a
great quantity of Corn, and when all's done,
what signifies two or three Heads of Corn
to a Beast in a Morning? It makes them
only linger about the Houses for more? and
after that sweet Food they are not so prompt
to browse on the Trees, and the course Grass
which the Country affords. So that thus
their Guts shrink up, and they become Belly-shot
as they call it. I advised therefore never
to give them any thing in a Morning,
whereby as soon as they were set forth of
the Cow-pens, they would fall a feeding, and
tho' they filled their Bellies only with such
course stuff as had little Nourishment in it,
yet it would keep out their Bellies, and they
would have a better Digestion; and then
when they were come home at Nights, to
Fodder them, beginning with Straw and
their coarsest Fodder, which they would learn
to eat by degrees, before they tasted that
that was more delicate, and whilst their digestion
was strong, would yield them Nourishment
to keep them still so; afterwards
when the Winter pinched, their fine Fodder
then would stand them in stead; and
hereby they might preserve their weakest
Cattle. By these Methods, and the help of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
the Wheat-patch, she, the Gentlewoman
where I lived, saved all her Cattle, and lost
not one in Two Winters after, that I staid
there; besides she saved above Twenty Barrels
of Corn, as I remember that she told
me she used to spend upon her Stock; and
a Barrel of Corn is commonly worth Ten
Shillings. Nay further, The last Spring she
fed Two Beasts, a Bullock and a Cow, Fat,
upon her Wheat, with the addition only of
a little boil'd Corn, and yet the Wheat was
scarce eat down enough. But to return again
to the Nature of the Earth, which may be
pretty well gather'd from what I have already
said. I have observed, that at Five
or Six yards deep, at the breaks of some
banks, I have found veins of Clay, admirable
good to make Pots, Pipes, or the like
of, and whereof I suppose the <em>Indians</em> make
their Pipes, and Pots, to boil their Meat in,
which they make very handsomly, and will
endure the Fire better than most Crucibles:
I took of this Clay, dryed, powder'd, and
sifted it; powdered and sifted Potsherds,
and Glass; Three parts, Two parts and One
part as I remember, and therewith made a
large Crucible, which was the best I yet ever
tried in my Life; I took it once red hot out
of the Fire, and clapt it immediately into
Water, and it started not at all. The Country
abounds mightily with Iron Oar, that as
I have been assured by some upon tryal,
has been found very good. There are Rocks
thereof appear at the precipice of Hills, at
the foot whereof there runs a River fit for a
Forge, and there's Wood enough to supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
it with Charcoal; as I have heard there was
formerly some Persons undertook the Work,
and when they had made but a small quantity
of Iron, which proved very good, the
<em>Indian</em> Massacre happened, and they being
higher seated than the then Inhabited part
of the Country, were all cut off, and the
Works demolished; so that it has frighted
others I think from the like attempt; besides,
such a work requires a greater Fund,
and Bank of Mony to carry it on, than any there
are able to lay out; and for Persons in <em>England</em>
to meddle therewith, is certainly to be
cheated at such a distance; some <em>Indians</em>
brought Col. <em>Bird</em> some Black Lead, whereof
he told me there was great store. There's
very curious Chalk towards the falls of <em>Rapahanock</em>
River, which they burn and make
a delicate white Wash of it. The Secretary
of State Col. <em>Spencer</em>, has assured me, there were
Vitriolick or Alluminous Earth on the Banks
of <em>Potomack</em>. And thus far of what my Memory
supplies me, referring to the Earth;
in the next place I shall give a short account
of the Birds.</p>


<h3><em>Of the BIRDS</em></h3>

<p>I had indeed begun once whilst I was in
that Country to have made a Collection
of the Birds, but falling sick of the Griping
of the Guts, some of them for want of care
corrupted, which made them fling others
away that I had thoroughly cured; for I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
past taking care of them my self, there remaining
but small hopes of my Life.</p>

<p>There are Three sorts of Eagles, the largest
I take to be that they call the Grey Eagle,
being much of the colour of our Kite or
Glead.</p>

<p>The Second is the Bald Eagle, for the Body
and part of the Neck being of a dark
brown, the upper part of the Neck and
Head is covered with a white sort of Down,
whereby it looks very bald, whence it is so
named.</p>

<p>The Third is the Black Eagle, resembling
most the <em>English</em> Eagle; they build their Nests
much after the manner that Dr. <em>Willoughby</em>
describes, and generally at the top of some
tall old Tree, naked of Bows and nigh the
River side, and the People fall the Tree generally
when they take the young; they are
most frequently sitting on some tall Tree by
the River side, whence they may have a prospect
up and down the River, as I suppose
to observe the Fishing Hauks; for when they
see the Fishing Hauk has struck a Fish, immediately
they take Wing, and 'tis sometimes
very pleasant to behold the Flight,
for when the Fishing Hauk perceives her self
pursued, she will scream and make a terrible
noise, till at length she lets fall the Fish
to make her own escape, which the Eagle
frequently catches before it reach the Earth
or Water. These Eagles kill young Lambs,
Pigs, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p>The Fishing Hauk is an absolute Species
of a Kings-fisher, but full as large, or larger
than our Jay, much of the Colour and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
Shape of a Kings-fisher, tho' not altogether
so curiously Feather'd; it has a large Crop,
as I remember, there is a little Kings-fisher
much the same in every respect with ours.</p>

<p>If I much mistake not, I have seen both
Goss Hauk and Falcon; besides there are
several sorts of the lesser Kind of Stannels.</p>

<p>There is likewise the Kite and the Ringtail.</p>

<p>I never heard the Cuckow there to my remembrance.</p>

<p>There's both a brown Owl and white Owl,
much what as large as a Goose, which often
kills their Hens and Poultry in the Night;
the white Owl is a very delicate Feather'd
Bird, all the Feathers upon her Breast and
Back being Snow-white, and tipp'd with a
Punctal of Jet-black: besides there is a Barn
Owl much like ours; and a little sort of
Scritch Owl.</p>

<p>There's both the Raven, and the Carrion-Crow;
I do not remember I ever saw any
Rooks there. Dr. <em>Moulin</em> and my self, when
we made our Anatomies together, when I
was at <em>London</em>, we shew'd to the <em>Royal Society</em>,
that all Flat-bill'd Birds that groped for their
Meat, had three Pair of Nerves, that came
down into their Bills; whereby as we conceived
they had that accuracy to distinguish
what was proper for Food, and what to be
rejected by their Taste when they did not
see it; and as this was most evident in a
Duck's Bill and Head, I draw'd a Cut thereof,
and left it in your Custody: A Duck
has larger Nerves that come into their Bills
than Geese or any other Bird that I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
seen and therefore quaffer and grope out
their Meat the most: But I had then discover'd
none of these Nerves in Round-bill'd
Birds: But since in my Anatomies in the
Country, in a Rook I first observed two
Nerves came down betwixt the Eyes into
the upper Bill, but considerably smaller than
any or the three Pair of Nerves in the Bills
of Ducks, but larger than the Nerves in any
other Round-bill'd Birds; and 'tis remarkable
these Birds more than any other Round-bill'd
Birds seem to grope for their Meat in
Cow-dung and the like: Since I have found
in several Round-bill'd Birds the like Nerves
coming down betwixt the Eyes, but so very
small that had I not seen them first in a
Rook I should scarce have made the discovery;
in the lower Bill there are Nerves have
much the same situation with the Flat-bill'd
Birds, but very small, and scarce discernable,
unless to the Cautious and Curious.</p>

<p>The Night Raven, which some call the
<em>Virginia</em> Bat, is about the bigness of a Cuckow,
feather'd like them but very short,
and short Leg'd, not discernable when it flies,
which is only in the Evening scudding like
our Night Raven.</p>

<p>There's a great sort of ravenous Bird that
feeds upon Carrion, as big very nigh as an
Eagle, which they call a Turky Bustard, its
Feathers are of a Duskish black, it has red
Gills, resembling those of a Turky, whence
it has its Name; it is nothing of the same
sort of Bird with our <em>English</em> Turky Bustard,
but is rather a Species of the Kites, for it
will hover on the Wing something like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
them, and is carnivorous; the Fat thereof
dissolved into an Oil, is recommended mightily
against old Aches and Sciatica Pains.</p>

<p>I think there are no Jackdaws, nor any
Magpys; they there prize a Magpye as much
as we do their Red Bird.</p>

<p>The <em>Pica Glandaria</em>, or Jay, is much less
than our <em>English</em> Jay, and of another colour,
for it is all blue where ours is brown, the
Wings marbled as curiously as ours are, it
has both the same Cry, and sudden jetting
Motion.</p>

<p>There are great Variety and Curiosity in
the Wood-peckers, there's one as big as our
Magpye, with blackish brown Feathers, and
a large Scarlet Tuft on the top of the Head:
There are four or five sorts of Wood-peckers
more, variegated with Green, Yellow
and Red Heads, others spotted black
and white, most lovely to behold. There's
a Tradition amongst them, that the Tongue
of one of these Wood-peckers dryed will
make the Teeth drop out if pick'd therewith,
and cure the Tooth-ach (tho' I believe little
of it, but look on it as ridiculous) yet I thought
fit to hint as much that others may try; for
sometimes such old Stories refer to some
peculiar Virtues, tho' not to all that is said
of them.</p>

<p>There be wild Turkies extream large; they
talk of Turkies that have been kill'd, that have
weigh'd betwixt 50 and 60 Pound weight;
the largest that ever I saw, weigh'd something
better than 38 Pound; they have very
long Legs, and will run prodigiously fast. I remember
not that ever I saw any of them on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
Wing, except it were once: Their Feathers
are of a blackish shining Colour, that in
the Sun shine like a Dove's Neck, very
specious.</p>

<p>Hens and Cocks are for the most part without
Tails and Rumps; and as some have assured
me our <em>English</em> Hens after some time
being kept there have their Rumps Rot off;
which I'm the apter to believe, being all
their Hens are certainly of <em>English</em> breed.
I'm sorry I made no Anatomical Observations
thereof, and Remarks about the Use of
the Rumps in Birds, which at present I take
to be a couple of Glands, containing a sort
of Juice for the Varnishing the Feathers;
having observed all Birds have much recourse
with their Bills to the Rumps when they
dress their Plumes, whereby they scud thro'
the Air more nimbly in their Flight.</p>

<p>Partridges there are much smaller than ours,
and resort in Covies as ours do; their Flesh
is very white, and much excels ours in my
mind, <em>Sed de gustibus non est disputandum</em>.</p>

<p>Their Turtle-Doves are of a duskish blue
colour, much less than our common Pidgeon,
the whole Train is longer much than the
Tails of our Pidgeons, the middle Feather
being the longest. There's the strangest
Story of a vast number of these Pidgeons
that came in a Flock a few Years before I
came thither; they say they came thro' <em>New
England</em>, <em>New York</em> and <em>Virginia</em>, and were so
prodigious in number as to darken the Sky
for several Hours in the place over which
they flew, and brake massie Bows where they
light; and many like things which I have had as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>serted
to me by many Eye-witnesses of Credit,
that to me it was without doubt, the
Relaters being very sober Persons, and all agreeing
in a Story: nothing of the like ever
happen'd since, nor did I ever see past Ten
in a Flock together that I remember. I am
not fond of such Stories, and had suppressed the
relating of it, but that I have heard the
same from very many.</p>

<p>The Thrush and Feldefire are much like
ours, and are only seen in Winter there, accordingly
as they are here.</p>

<p>Their Mocking Birds may be compared to
our Singing Thrushes, being much of the
same bigness; there are two sorts, the Gray
and the Red, the gray has Feathers much of
the colour of our gray Plovers with white
in the Wings like a Magpye; this has the
much softer Note, and will imitate, in its
singing, the Notes of all Birds that it hears,
and is accounted much the finest Singing Bird
in the World. Dr. <em>Moulin</em> and I made in
our Anatomy many Observations of Singing
Birds to this effect: The Ears of Birds differ
much from those of Men or Beasts, there's
almost a direct passage from one Ear to the
other of Birds, so that prick but the small
Membrane call'd the Drum on either Ear,
and Water poured in at one Ear will run out
at the other: But this is not all, but what
is much more remarkable, they have no Coclea,
but instead thereof there's a small Cocleous
or twisting Passage that opens into a
large Cavity, that runs betwixt two Sculls,
and passes all round the Head, the upper
Scull is supported by many hundreds of small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
Thred-like Pillars or Fibers, which as we
supposed had another use also, to break the
Sound from making any confused Echo, and
to make it one and distinct; this passage we
observed betwixt the two Skulls was much
larger in Singing Birds than in others that
do not sing, so very remarkable that any
Person that has been but show'd this may easily
judge by the Head what Bird is a Singing
Bird, or has aptitude thereto, tho' he never
saw the Bird before, nor knew what Bird it
were: This has often made me reflect how
much the Modification of Voices depends
upon the accuracy of the Ear, and how deaf
Persons become Dumb: And since I have observed
that many Children that have an
acute Wit enough that are slow of Speech,
that is long before they speak are much longer
before they can pronounce those Letters
that are sharps, as <em>g.</em> <em>h.</em> <em>r.</em> and never have an
aptitude to learn to sing. Hence I judge
that Songs that have many Sharps in them
are the difficultest to sing well, and discover any
Persons skill upon the trial of Musick most. This
I suppose only, having no Skill in Musick my
self, nor having ever discoursed any Person
about it. As I remember we show'd some of
these things to the <em>Royal Society</em>, and I drew
some Cuts thereof, and gave the Doctor upon
promise that he would put these and many
other our joint Observations in Print, but I
hear he is since dead. I have Anatomized
most sorts of Creatures, and never found any
Four-footed Creature with an Ear like a
Bird, unless a Mole; and a Mole has an
Ear much like them, with a very thin double
Scull, and great Cavity like a Bird, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
is very acute of hearing, the Scull by reason
of the large Cavity is very slender and
easily crush'd, so that a Mole is quickly kill'd
with a bruise on the Scull like a Lark, and
upon the bruise the Membranes of the Scull
turn black; whence <em>Segerus</em> mistake <em>Membranæ
Cerebri in superficie exteriori omnino nigræ visæ</em>.
But when I have taken care not to bruise
the Skull the Membranes were not black at
all, both <em>Segerus</em> and <em>Severinus</em> I think had
some perceptions of the different Structure of
a Mole's Ear, but not any thing of its Analogy
to a Bird's Ear; they speak of a Bone
<em>Egregie pumicosum</em>: And <em>Segerus</em> says there's a
<em>Ductus ad ossis usque petrosi cavitatem protensus,
plurimis fibrillis Membraneis annectabatur</em>. But
to return, this Mocking Bird having its
Name from <em>Mimicking</em>, all other Birds in
singing is a wonderful mettled Bird, bold
and brisk, and yet seems to be of a very tender
Constitution, neither singing in Winter,
nor in the midst of Summer, and with much
difficulty are any of them brought to live in
<em>England</em>.</p>

<p>The Red Mocking is of a duskish red, or
rather brown; it sings very well, but has not
so soft a Note as the gray Mocking Bird.</p>

<p>Of <em>Virginia</em> Nightingale, or red Bird,
there are two sorts, the Cocks of both sorts
are of a pure Scarlet, the Hens of a Duskish
red; I distinguish them into two sorts, for
the one has a tufted Cops on the Head, the
other is smooth-feather'd. I never saw a
tufted Cock with a smooth-headed Hen, or
on the contrary; they generally resorting a
Cock and Hen together, and play in a Thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>et
of Thorns or Bryars in the Winter, nigh
to which the Boys set their Traps, and so
catch them and sell them to the Merchants
for about Six Pence apiece; by whom they
are brought for <em>England</em>; they are something
less than a Thrush.</p>

<p>There's a Bird very injurious to Corn, they
call a Blackbird; I look on it a sort of Starling,
for they cry something like them but
do not sing, are much what of the same bigness,
have Flesh blackish like theirs; they
resort in great Flocks together, they are as
black as a Crow all over their Bills and all,
only some of them have scarlet Feathers in
the Pinions of their Wings. <em>Quæry</em>, Whether
a distinct Species?</p>

<p>They have a Lark nothing differing from
our common Lark; they have another Bird
which they call a Lark that is much larger,
as big as a Starling, it has a soft Note,
feeds on the Ground; and as I remember has
the Specifical Character of a long Heel, it
is more inclined to yellow, and has a large
half Moon on its Breast of yellow; if it have
not a long Heel, <em>Quære</em>, Whether a Species
of the Yellow-hammer?</p>

<p>They have a Martin very like, only larger
than ours, that builds after the same manner.
The honourable Col. <em>Bacon</em> has remarked
for several Years, that they constantly come
thither upon the Tenth of <em>March</em> one or two
of them appearing before, being seen hovering
in the Air for a Day or two then go away,
and as he supposed return'd with the
great Flock. The Colonel delighted much
in this Bird, and made like Pidgeon-holes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
at the end of his House with Boards purposely
for them.</p>

<p>Their Swallow differs but little from ours.</p>

<p>They have a Bird they call a Blue-bird,
of a curious azure colour about the bigness
of a Chaffinch.</p>

<p>There be other sorts of Goldfinches variegated
with Orange and Yellow Feathers, very
specious and beautiful.</p>

<p>Sparrows not much different from the <em>English</em>,
but build not in the Eaves of Houses
that ever I saw.</p>

<p>The Snow-bird which I take to be much
the same with our Hedge-Sparrow; this is so
called because it seldom appears about Houses
but against Snow or very cold Weather.</p>

<p>The Humming Bird that feeds upon the
Honey of Flowers: I have been told by some
Persons, that they have kept of these Humming
Birds alive, and fed them with Water
and Sugar: they are much the smallest of all
Birds, have long Bills and curious coloured
Feathers, but differ much in colour.</p>

<p>Herons three or four several sorts, one
larger than the <em>English</em>, feather'd much like
a <em>Spanish</em> Goose.</p>

<p>Another sort that only comes in Summer
Milk white, with red Legs very lovely to
behold.</p>

<p>The Bittern is there less than in <em>England</em>,
and does not make that sounding Noise that
ever I heard.</p>

<p>Curlews something less than our <em>English</em>,
tho' bigger than a Wimbrel.</p>

<p>The Sandpiper much resembling the <em>English</em>.</p>

<p>The Snipe, two sorts, one resembling ours,
the other much less.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>The Tewits are smaller than the <em>English</em>,
and have no long Toppins, but just like a
young one that begins to fly.</p>

<p>There are a great number of wild Swans.</p>

<p>Wild-geese and Brent-geese all Winter in
mighty Flocks, Wild-ducks innumerable,
Teal, Wigeon, Sheldrakes, Virginia-didapers,
the Black-diver, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p>In my return home for <em>England</em>, <em>May 1686.</em>,
off of the Banks of <em>Newfoundland</em>, when we
were, according to account, a hundred
Leagues from the Shoar, we saw several prodigious
floating Islands of the Ice, no less to
our Wonder than Terror, for they were very
dangerous: I got the Master to sail one day
as nigh one of them as we securely durst,
which we judged to be full a League in length,
and was higher above Water than the top
of our Main-mast; the Snow drove to and
fro upon it as upon a large Plane. There
was a great Flock of small Black-divers, that
were not much bigger than a Fieldfare, came
to us a little before, but all of them then left
and betook themselves to this Island of Ice.
They dived the constantly'st, and the longest
at a time of any Bird that I ever saw. We
saw, as I remember, nigh Thirty of these
Islands of Ice. Captain <em>Rider</em> being some
fews days later in his Passage, and bearing
more to the <em>Nore</em>, told me, he saw many
more of these Islands of Ice, and some much
larger.</p>

<p>There are in <em>Virginia</em> a great many Cormorants;
several sorts of Gulls, and in about
the Bay many Bannets. Thus much for the
Birds.</p>

<h2><em>A Continuation of Mr. <strong>Clayton</strong>'s
Account of <strong>Virginia</strong>.</em></h2>


<h3><em>Of the Beasts of <strong>Virginia</strong>.</em></h3>

<p>There were neither Horses, Bulls,
Cows, Sheep, or Swine, in all the
Country, before the coming of the <em>English</em>,
as I have heard, and have much reason to
believe. But now among the <em>English</em> Inhabitants
there are good store of Horses, though
they are very negligent and careless about
the Breed: It is true, there is a Law, that
no Horse shall be kept stoned under a certain
size, but it is not put in execution. Such as
they are, there are good store, and as cheap
or cheaper than in <em>England</em>, worth about
Five Pounds apiece. They never Shoe them,
nor Stable them in general; some few Gentlemen
may be something more Curious, but
it is very rare; yet they Ride pretty sharply,
a Planter's Pace is a Proverb, which is a
good sharp Hand-Gallop. The <em>Indians</em> have
not yet learned to Ride, only the King of
<em>Pomonkie</em> had got three or four Horses for his
own Saddle, and an Attendant, which I think
should in no wise be indulged, for I look on
the allowing them Horses much more dangerous
than even Guns and Powder.</p>

<p><em>Wild Bulls</em> and <em>Cows</em> there are now in the
uninhabited Parts, but such only as have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
been bred from some that have strayed, and
become Wild, and have propagated their
kind, and are difficult to be shot, having a
great Acuteness of Smelling. The common
rate of a Cow and Calf is 50<em>s.</em> sight unseen,
be she big or little, they are never very curious
to examine that Point.</p>

<p>Their <em>Sheep</em> are of a middling size, pretty
fine fleeced in general, and most Persons of
Estate begin to keep Flocks, which hitherto
has not been much regarded, because of the
Wolves that destroy them; so that a piece of
Mutton is a finer Treat, than either Venison,
Wild-Goose, Duck, Wigeon, or Teal.</p>

<p><em>Elke</em>, I have heard of them beyond the
Inhabitants, and that there was one presented
to Sir <em>William Berkley</em>, which he sometime
kept.</p>

<p><em>Deer</em>, there are abundance of brave Red
Deer, so that a good Woodsman, as they
call them, will keep a House with Venison;
the <em>Indians</em>, they say, make Artificial sorts of
Heads of Boughs of Trees, which they Consecrate
to their Gods, and these they put on
to deceive the Deer when they go a Shooting,
or Hunting, as they call it, and by mimicking
the Feeding of the Deer, they by degrees
get within Shot.</p>

<p><em>Swine</em>, they have now in great abundance,
Shoats or Porkrels are their general Food;
and I believe as good as any <em>Westphalia</em>, certainly
far exceeding our <em>English</em>.</p>

<p><em>Rackoone</em>, I take it to be a Species of a
Monkey, something less than a Fox gray-hair'd,
its Feet formed like a Hand, and the Face
too has likewise the resemblance of a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>Monkeys,
besides being kept tame they are very
Apish: They are very prejudicial to their
Poultry, as I remember.</p>

<p>An <em>Opossum</em>, as big, and something shaped
like our Badgers, but of a lighter Dun colour,
with a long Tail something like a Rat,
but as thick as a Man's Thumb; the Skin
of its Belly is very large, and folded so as to
meet like a Purse, wherein they secure their
Young whilst little and tender, which will as
naturally run thither, as Chickens to a Hen;
in these False Bellies they will carry their
Young; these also feed on, and devour Corn.</p>

<p><em>Hares</em>, many will have them to be a Hedge-Rabbet,
but I know not what they mean
thereby. I take them to be a perfect Species
of Hares, because I have seen Leverets there
with the white spot in the Head which the
Old ones have not, so it is in <em>England</em>; and
the Down is perfectly of the colour of our
Hares, they sit as our Hares do, and make
no Holes and Burrows in the Earth; true,
they are but about the bigness of an <em>English</em>
Rabbet, and run no faster; they generally
take into some hollow Tree within a little
space, which then the People catch by gathering
the withered Leaves, and setting them on
fire within the hollow of the Tree, and
smoaking of them so till they fall down.
Sometimes they take long Bryars, and twist
them in the Down and Skin, and so pull
them forth.</p>

<p><em>Squirrels</em>, there are three sorts. The first
is the great Fox Squirrel, much larger than
the <em>English</em>, and gray, almost as a common
Rabbet. These are very common, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
eaten of them at the best Gentlemen's Tables,
and they are as good as a Rabbet. The Second
is the Flying Squirrel, of a lighter Dun
colour, and much less than the <em>English</em> Squirrel;
the Skin on either side the Belly extended
is very large betwixt the fore-leg and
hind-leg, which helps them much in their
skipping from one Bough to another, that
they will leap farther than the Fox-Squirrel,
though much less, yet this is still rather skipping
than flying, though the distinction be
well enough. The Third is the Ground-Squirrel,
I never saw any of this sort, only
I have been told of them, and have had them
thus described to me, to be little bigger than
a Mouse, finely spotted like a young Fawn;
by what I further apprehended, they are an
absolute sort of Dor-Mouse, only different
in colour.</p>

<p><em>Musk-Rats</em>, in all things shaped like our
Water-Rats, only something larger, and is
an absolute Species of Water-Rats, only having
a curious Musky scent: I kept one for a
certain time in a wooden Chest; two days
before it died it was extraordinary Odoriferous,
and scented the Room very much; but
the day that it died, and a day after the scent
was very small, yet afterwards the Skin was
very fragrant; the Stones also smelt very
well. They build Houses as Beavers do, in
the Marshes and Swamps (as they there call
them) by the Water-sides, with two or three
ways into them, and they are finely daubed
within. I pulled one in pieces purposely to
see the contrivance: There were three different
Lodging-Rooms, very neat, one high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>er
than another, as I conceive purposely
made for Retirement, when the Water rises
higher than ordinary; they are considerably
large, having much Trash and Lumber to
make their Houses withal; I suppose they
live mostly on Fish.</p>

<p><em>Batts</em>, as I remember at least two sorts;
one a large sort with long Ears, and particularly
long straggling Hairs. The other
much like the <em>English</em>, something larger I
think, very common.</p>

<p>I never heard of any <em>Lions</em>; they told me
of a Creature killed whilst I was there, in
<em>Glocester</em> County, which I conceived to be a
sort of Pard, or Tyger.</p>

<p><em>Bears</em> there are, and yet but few in the
Inhabited part of <em>Virginia</em>; towards <em>Carolina</em>
there are many more. There was a small
Bear killed within three Miles of <em>James City</em>
the Year that I left the Country, but it was
supposed to have strayed, and swam over
<em>James River</em>. They are not very fierce, their
Flesh is commended for a very rich sort of
Pork; but the lying side of the Bear, as I
remember, is but half the value of the other,
weight for weight.</p>

<p>There are several sorts of <em>Wild-Cats</em> and
<em>Poll-Cats</em>.</p>

<p><em>Beavers</em> build their Houses in like manner
as the Musk-Rats do, only much larger,
and with pieces of Timber make Dams over
Rivers; as I suppose either to preserve their
Furs dry in their passage over the Rivers,
otherwise to catch Fish by standing to watch
them thereon, and jumping upon them on a
sudden; they are very subtil Creatures, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
if half the Stories be true that I have been
told, they have a very orderly Government
among them; in their Works each knows
his proper Work and Station, and the Overseers
beat those Young Ones that loiter in
their Business, and will make them cry, and
work stoutly.</p>

<p><em>Wolves</em> there are great store; you may hear
a Company Hunting in an Evening, and
yelping like a pack of Beagles; but they are
very cowardly, and dare scarce venture on
any thing that faces them; yet if Hungry,
will pull down a good large Sheep that flies
from them. I never heard that any of them
adventured to set on Man or Child.</p>

<p><em>Foxes</em>, they are very much like ours, only
their Fur is much more grisled, or gray;
neither do I remember ever to have seen any
Fox-holes, but of this I am not positive.</p>

<p>Every House keeps three or four Mungrel
<em>Dogs</em> to destroy Vermin, such as <em>Wolves</em>, <em>Foxes</em>,
<em>Rackoons</em>, <em>Opossums</em>, &amp;c. But they never
Hunt with Hounds, I suppose, because there
are so many Branches of Rivers, that they
cannot follow them. Neither do they keep
Grey-Hounds, because they say, that they are
subject to break their Necks by running against
Trees, and any Cur will serve to run
their Hares into a hollow Tree, where after
the aforesaid manner they catch them.</p>

<p>They have great store both of Land and
Water <em>Tortoises</em>, but they are very small, I
think I never saw any in that Country to exceed
a Foot in length; there is also another
sort of Land-Tortoise, different from the
common sort, with a higher ridged Back, and
speckled with red sort of Spots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Frogs</em> they have of several sorts, one of a
prodigious largeness, eight or ten times as
big as any in <em>England</em>, and it makes a strange
noise, something like the Bellowing of a
Bull, or betwixt that and the hollow sounding
noise that the English Bittern makes.</p>

<p>Another very common sort, which they
call <em>Toads</em>, because black, but I think differs
nothing from our black Frog. They have
Toads also like ours in <em>England</em>; and another
small sort of Frog, which makes a noise like
Pack-horse Bells all the Spring long. Another
little green Frog, that will leap
prodigiously, which they therefore call
the Flying Frog. There is frequently
heard in the Woods a shrill sort of noise,
much like that which our Shrew-Mouse
makes, but much sharper; I could never
learn the certainty what it was that made
this noise, it is generally in a Tree, and some
have asserted to me, that it was made by the
green Frog, yet I scarcely believe it. Mr.
<em>Banister</em> assured me it was made by a sort of
<em>Scarabeus</em> Beetle, that is I think full as big as
the Humming-Bird; but neither do I believe
that, and for this Reason, for I never saw
that Beetle so low as the Salts, but always as
high up in the Country as the Freshes,
and that noise is frequent all over the
Country.</p>

<p><em>Lizards</em>, that are gray, and very common,
the Snakes feed much on them, for I have
taken several of them out of the Bellies of
Snakes.</p>

<p><em>Snakes</em>, about seven several sorts. The
Rattle-Snake, so called from certain Rattles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
at the end of the Tail: These Rattles seem
like so many perished Joints, being a dry
Husk over certain Joints, and the common
Opinion is, that there are as many Rattles
or Joints, as the Snake is years old. I kill'd
four or five, and they had each eleven,
twelve, or thirteen Joints each; but the
young Ones have no Rattles of a year or
two, but they may be known notwithstanding,
being very regularly diced or checker'd,
black and gray on the backs. The Old
shake and shiver these Rattles with wonderful
nimbleness when they are any ways disturbed;
their bite is very deadly, yet not
always of the same force, but more or less
Mortal, accordingly as the Snake is in force
or vigour, and therefore in <em>June</em> or <em>July</em> much
worse, and more Mortal, than in <em>March</em> and
<em>April</em>. This Snake is a very Majestick sort
of Creature, and will scarce meddle with
any thing unless provok'd, but if any thing
offend it, it makes directly at them. I was
told a pleasant Story of an Old Gentlemen,
Col. <em>Cleyborn</em> as I remember was his Name,
the same that sent the Rattle-Snakes to the
<em>Royal Society</em> some Years since. He had an
odd Fancy of keeping some of these Snakes
always in Barrels in the House, and one time
an <em>Indian</em> pretending to Charm them so as to
take them by the Neck in his Hand without
biting of him; the Old Gentleman caused a
Rattle-Snake to be brought forth, the <em>Indian</em>
began his Charm with a little Wand, whisking
it round and round the Rattle-Snake's
Head, bringing it by degrees nigher and
nigher, and at length flung the Switch away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
and whisked his Hand about in like manner,
bringing his Hand nigher still and nigher,
by taking less Circles, when the old
Gentleman immediately hit the Snake with
his Crutch, and the Snake snap'd the <em>Indian</em>
by the Hand, and bit him very sharply betwixt
the Fingers, which put his Charm to
an end, and he roared out; but stretch'd his
Arm out as high as he could, calling for a
string, wherewith he bound his Arm as hard
as possibly he could, and clapt a hot burning
Coal thereon, and singed it stoutly, whereby
he was cured, but looked pale a long while
after. And I believe this truly one of the
best ways in the World of Curing the Bite
either of Viper or Mad Dog. I was with
the Honourable Esquire <em>Boyle</em>, when he made
certain Experiments of Curing the Bite of
Vipers with certain <em>East-India</em> Snake-stones,
that were sent him by King <em>James</em> the Second,
the Queen, and some of the Nobility,
purposely to have him try their Vertue and
Efficacy: For that end he got some brisk
Vipers, and made them bite the Thighs of
certain Pullets, and the Breasts of others:
He applied nothing to one of the Pullets,
and it died within three Minutes and a half,
as I remember; but I think they all recovered
to which he applied the Snake-stones, tho'
they turned wonderful pale, their Combs,
<em>&amp;c.</em> immediately, and they became extream
sick, and purged within half an hour, and
the next morning all their Flesh was turned
green to a wonder, nevertheless they recovered
by degrees. The manner of the Application
was only by laying on the Stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
and by two cross-bits of a very sticking <em>Diaculum</em>
Plaister binding it on, which he let not
lie on past an hour or two, but I think not
so long, took the Stone off, and put it into
Milk for some time; some Stones were of
much stronger Vertue than others. I proposed
a piece of unquench'd Lime-stone to be
apply'd to see whether it might not prove as
powerful, but know not whether ever it was
tried. But here one telling Mr. <em>Boyle</em> the
Story of this <em>Indian</em>, he approved the method
of Cure, and said, an actual Cautery was
the most certain Cure. The Poison, both of
Viper and Mad-Dog (as I conceive) kill by
thickning of the Blood, after the manner
that Runnet congeals Milk when they make
Cheese. Vipers, and all the Viperous Brood,
as Rattle-Snakes, <em>&amp;c.</em> that are deadly, have
I believe their Poisonous Teeth Fistulous, for
so I have observed that Vipers Teeth are,
and the Rattle-Snakes very remarkable, and
therefore they kill so very speedily by injecting
the Poison through those Fistulous Teeth
into the very Mass of Blood; but the bite of
Mad-Dogs is oft of long continuance before
it get into and corrupt the Mass of Blood,
being it sticks only to the out-sides of the
Teeth, and therefore when they bite thro'
any thickness of Cloaths, it rarely proves
Mortal, the Cloaths wiping the Poison off
before it come to the Flesh. A Girl that
was bit about <em>New-Years Day</em>, continued well
till <em>Whitsontide</em>, when coming to see certain
Friends in our Parts, she fell very ill, and
being a Poor Girl, they came to me; it
pleased God I recovered her. Sometime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
after she returned to give me thanks for
saving her Life, being two Persons that were
bit with the same Dog, were dead, whilst
she remained under Cure, and therefore she
was the fullier convinc'd she owed her life to
me; but of this I shall give a more particular
Instance by and by. But the Poisons of
Vipers seems to be like the injecting of Liquors
into the Veins of Creatures; Dr. <em>Moulin</em>
and I made many Experiments of this
Nature together, and I have made many more
by my self. We once, I remember, injected half
a Dram of Allom into the Jugalar-Vein of
a Dog before the <em>Royal Society</em>, (the Allom
being only dissolved in a little Water) which
within something less than one Minutes time
was so absolutely dead, as not to have the
least Convulsive Motion; and I have done
the like with many other things besides Allom,
but with some things it is more curdled and
broken, than with others; and will differ
much both as to colour and consistence.
Salt-Petre kills much as quickly as Allom,
but then the Blood in the Heart looks very
florid, smooth, and even. I wish some Person
of Observation and Leisure would prosecute
these sort of Experiments, and make
Injections of the several things most used in
Physick into the Veins of Creatures, both in
quantities, and into different Veins, as into
the Thigh-veins of some Dogs, and Jugalars
of some others, and in much lesser quantities
of such things as kill suddenly; for in the
little time I have spent in these sort of Experiments,
I easily perceive notable discoveries
might be made thereby: One Dog that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
lived became Lame and Gouty; another with
Quick-Silver died in about Sixteen Weeks
time, Consumptive, and I discovered Quick-Silver
in the Impostumated parts of his Lungs.
<em>Query</em>, Whether some Persons that have been
Flux'd, or used Quick-silver Oyntments, and
the like, and afterwards become consumptive,
owe not their Distemper to the abusive
use of a most excellent Remedy? Much
after the same manner, the subtile Quick-Silver
getting into the Mass of Blood by
degrees, through its ponderosity settles in
the Lobes of the Lungs, and causes Ulcers
there. But to return: The Poison of Vipers
and Mad Dogs I suppose kill by thickning
of the Blood, as many Malignant Fevers,
also do; in all which Cases, I look on
Volatil Salts to be the properest Physick, as
keeping the Blood from congealing. I had a
singular Instance hereof in a Gentleman of
<em>Yorkshire</em>, bit with a Grey-Hound on the
<em>Thursday</em>, not three Minutes before the Dog
died Mad; he bit him in several places of
the Hands, as he was giving him a Remedy:
The <em>Monday</em> following the Gentleman was
very ill, and came to our Town to an Apothecary
his Acquaintance, who knowing not
what to do, desired my Assistance. When I
came, the Gentleman could talk, but every
two or three Minutes he had violent Fits,
and would tell us when they were over, that
his Brains worked like Birm in an Ale-Fat,
and seemed to Froth up at every Fit. The
Apothecary had no Volatile Salt of Vipers;
so I took the Volatile Salt of Amber, and
ordered him Ten Grains in Treacle-Water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
every half hour: He told me every Dose
seemed to clear his Brain, and cool it as perfectly,
as if a Bason of Cold Water were
poured on his Head, but it returned by degrees
again: Having then a Volatile Salt by
me that Vomits very well, I gave him a Dose
thereof, it worked very well, and he was very
much better after it: I then ordered him to
continue the Volatile Salt of Amber once
every four hours, and at each two hours end,
that is betwixt, <em>Spec. Pleres Archonticon and
Rue pouder'd ana gr.</em> 15. whereby he was so
well recovered, that within two days he would
needs go home, to look after some urgent Affairs,
and afterwards found himself so well,
that he forgot to return, and perfect the
course; and I heard no more of him for half
a Year, when I was fetch'd one Morning to
him in great hast. He had been abroad,
play'd the Good-Fellow, and in his return
home, having rode a great days Journey, being
weary, and I suppose finding himself indisposed,
he staid all Night in our Town, it
being fortunately in his way. In the Morning
when he should have got up, he could not
stand, whereupon the Apothecary was sent
for, and a Surgeon to Blood him, which was
accordingly done, but he grew worse; for in
this Case I look upon Bleeding to be very
prejudicial, as well as in most Malignant Fevers,
for thereby the Spirits are diminished,
and the Blood congeal'd the sooner. When
they had done all they could, and the Symptoms
still increased, they at length sent for
me. I never saw Man or Creature in that
Agony in all my life, that I found him in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Senseless, and Mad, when at best, but every
Minute the fiercest shiverings ran through
him, his Eyes would first roll and then set,
as if ready to start out of his Head, but above
all, the Swelling and Luctation at his
Breast, was as if he would burst, which went
off with a prodigious sigh: All this I judge
the Effects of the Heart labouring to discharge
it self of the stagnating Blood, and the Nervous
Convulsions as consequences thereof.
And I am the more confirm'd in this, from
what I saw in a Woman that was bit also
with a Mad-Dog in the Leg, and fell ill the
very day that she had paid the Chirurgeon
for her Cure; and notwithstanding all that
could be done, growing worse, they sent for
me; I went, and found her with what is called
a <em>Hydrophobia</em>: She would look earnestly after
Drink or Water, and seem to desire it, but
as soon as she began to drink, away it went,
be it what it would, with the greatest Violence
she could possibly fling it. I gave her the
Vomit hereafter and also before mentioned,
but she got but little of it down, and I had
no more with me; nevertheless it so brought
her to her self, that she could answer Questions,
and I asked her, whether she was afraid
of the Drink and Water, when she flung the
Cups in that violent manner from her? She said
No; but when she offered to drink, her Breast
and Heart would not let her. I asked, whether
through any Aversion or Fear? She said,
No, she was very Thirsty; but when she offered
to drink, it struck to her Heart, and
stopped her Breath. That is, as I apprehend,
the cold Drink passing down the Throat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
struck a chillness in the Blood, and made it
readier to stagnate: Besides the very act of
Drinking, hindering the free breathing, conduced
also much thereto; and therefore the
Heart was so suddenly oppress'd, that she
could not forbear flinging away whatever she
had in her Hand. She complained also of a
great rigour and stiffness or straitness of the
Muscles of her Breast, so that possibly the
Spiritous Liquor that flows in the <em>Genus Nervosum</em>
may be congeal'd as well as the Blood;
or the same Effects may be supposed notwithstanding
to be the result of the condensed
Blood clogging both the Heart and Lungs,
so that the Breast may seem to be straitened
therewith. The same I judge to be the cause
of all the violent Luxations in this Gentleman,
whose Fingers I looked on, and found
the places where he had formerly been bit,
turned blackish, and much inflamed about
them, which confirmed me in my sentiment,
that it was a relapse of his former Distemper,
that is, of the Bite of the Mad-Dog. I told
them, if any thing in the World would save
his Life, I judged it must be the former Vomit
of Volatile Salts; they could not tell
what to do, nevertheless such is the Malignancy
of the World, that as soon as it was
given, they ran away and left me, saying,
he was now certainly a dead Man, to have
a Vomit given in that condition. Nevertheless
it pleased God that he shortly after cried,
<em>This Fellow in the Black has done me good</em>,
and after the first Vomit, came so to himself,
as to know us all. I vomited him every other
day with this Vomit for three times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
and made him in the Interim to take Volatile
Salt of Amber, and the aforesaid Powders,
and to wash his Hands, and Sores in a strong
Salt Brine: to drink Posset-drink with Sage
and Rue, and by this course, and the Blessing
of God, his Life was saved, and he perfectly
cured, for it is now four Years since,
and he had had no Relapse. I have cured
several others by the same Method. Coll.
<em>Spencer</em>, the Secretary of State in <em>Virginia</em>, a
very Serious and Ingenious Gentleman, told
me, that his Servant brought him word once
that a Sow having farrow'd, a Rattle-Snake
was got into the Den, and had kill'd the Piggs.
The Colonel went to see the Snake, which
they said was still coyl'd in the Den; there
followed them two or three Mungrel Curs,
and they sat one of the Dogs at the Snake,
which was too quick for the Dog, and snapt
him by the Nose, whereupon he set a howling,
and run immediately into the adjacent
River, and died very shortly after. Another
of the Dogs upon the like attempt was bit by
the Snake also, and fell a howling, and frothing,
and tumbling; but being he died not
so soon as the other Dog did, they fetched
some of the Herb which they call Dittany, as
having a great Traditionary Vertue for the
Cure of Poisons; they pounded it, and adding
a little Water, express'd the Juice, and
gave the Dog frequently thereof, nevertheless
he died within a day or two. The howling
of the Dogs he supposed gave notice to
the Sow, and made her come furiously bristling,
and run immediately into her Den; but
being likewise bit by the Snake, she set up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
terrible Squeak, and ran also into the River,
and there died.</p>

<p>A Gentlewoman, that was a notable Female
Doctress, told me, that a Neighbour
being bit by a Rattle-Snake, swelled excessively;
some days afterwards she was sent for,
who found him swell'd beyond what she
thought it had been possible for the Skin to
contain, and very Thirsty. She gave him
<em>Oriental Bezoar</em> shaved, with a strong Decoction
of the aforesaid Dittany, whereby she
recovered the Person: To the best of my Remembrance,
it was he that told me, asking
him afterwards, what he felt when the Snake
first bit him? He said, it seemed as if a flash
of Fire had ran through his Veins.</p>

<p>Besides the Rattle-Snake, there is the Blowing-Snake,
an absolute Species of a Viper,
but larger than any that I have seen in <em>Europe</em>;
it is so called, because it seems to blow,
and spread its Head, and swell very much before
it bite, which is very deadly. It is Remarkable
there is none of their Snakes there,
make any of that hissing noise that ours in
<em>England</em> make, but only shoot out their
Tongues, shaking them as ours do, without
any noise at all; this is a short thick sort of
Snake. There is another sort of deadly Snake,
called the <em>Red-Snake</em>; I once narrowly escaped
treading on the back of one of them: They
are of an ugly dark brown colour, inclining
to red; their Bellies are of a more dusky
white, with a large streak of Vermillion Red
on either side; this too is of the Viper kind,
but is not so short, but its Tail is more taper
and small. The <em>Horn-Snake</em> is, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
say, another sort of deadly Snake; I never
saw any of them, unless once, shortly after
my Arrival in that Country, which I cannot
attest to be the Horn-Snake, for I could not
distinctly view it, being in a Thicket of <em>Sumach</em>,
it was perch'd up about two Foot high
in a <em>Sumach</em> Branch, its Tail twisted about
the Shrub, and about a quarter of a Yard
stood bolt forward, leaning over the forked
branch thereof: I could not see the Horn,
which they say it has in its front, wherewith
it strikes, and if it wounds, is as deadly as
the Rattle-Snake's bite. The Gentleman
that was with me, told me it was a Horn-Snake,
but being in hast, and on Horse-back,
and the Snake in a Thicket, I could not see
the Horn; but had I thought I should never
have seen more of them, I should have took
a little pains to have been better satisfied.
This I think may not improperly be referr'd
to the <em>Dart-Snakes</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Black-Snake</em>, is the largest I think of
all others, but I am sure the most common;
I have kill'd several of them full six Foot long,
their Bite is not deemed Mortal, but it swells,
and turns to a Running Sore; they feed upon
Lizards, Mice, Rats, Frogs, and Toads,
which I have taken out of their Bellies. I
was once a Simpling in the woods, on a fair
Sun-shine day, when I saw a Snake crawling
on a Tree that was fallen, and licking with
its forked Tongue as it moved; I stood still
to observe it, and saw it lick up small Insects
and Flies with wonderful nimbleness, catching
them betwixt the Forks of its Tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>Corn-Snake</em>, most like the Rattle-Snake
of all others in colour, but the Checkers are
not so regular, neither has it any Rattles:
They are most frequent in the Corn-Fields,
and thence I suppose so called; the Bite is
not so venomous as the Black-Snakes.</p>

<p>The <em>Water-Snake</em>, a small Snake, I never
saw any of them above a Yard long, though
I have sometimes seen Forty or Fifty at once;
they are of an ugly dark blackish colour:
They say, they are the least Venomous of
any.</p>

<h2><em>Part of Two Letters from Mr. <strong>J.
Hillier</strong>, dated <strong>Cape Corse</strong>, <strong>Jan.
3. 1687/8.</strong> and <strong>Apr. 25. 1688.</strong>
Wrote to the Reverend Dr. <strong>Bathurst</strong>,
President of <strong>Trinity
Colledge, Oxon</strong>; giving an
Account of the Customs of the
Inhabitants, the Air, <strong>&amp;c.</strong> of
that Place, together with an Account
of the Weather there from
<strong>Nov. 24. 1686.</strong> to the same
Day 1687.</em></h2>


<p class="right"><em>Cape Corse, Jan. 3. 1687/8.</em></p>

<p>I Thought the Custom of destroying Slaves
at the Death of great People had been
abolish'd, and I was so inform'd; but we have
seen that it is not; for <em>Oct. 3.</em> this Year, died
<em>Ahen Penin Ashrive</em>, King of <em>Feton</em>, here at
<em>Cape Corse</em>, where he had been long sick; the
Fetishers had done all they could to save his
Life, which was nothing at all to purpose;
their Physick scarce extends to any thing but
the Flux, and what we call the French Disease;
his was a Consumption and an Asthma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
(if I mistake not the Word) of a great continuance:
so they fled to the Aid of their
Religion, and according it seems to the Rules
of that, they made several Pellets of Clay,
which they set in his Room, in Rank and
File, all sprinkled with blood; besides the several
Muttons which they eat to his good
Health. But that was of too little Force;
so the Man died, having delivered his Sword
to the Dy, who in the <em>Interregnum</em> was to be
the principal Man, for the Kingdom is Elective,
contrary to what we wrote before, and
commanding him to be constant to the <em>English</em>,
of whom himself had been a great Favourer,
with a Threat, if he was not, of
haunting him after his Death; he also appointed
one of his Wives, whom he thought
worthy of that unlucky Honour, to accompany
him to the other World; the next Day
he was carried to <em>Feton</em>, and buried there,
<em>Nov. 2.</em> with the poor Woman we spoke of.
Presently after, they that were considerable,
or had a mind to seem so, sent in them that
they had a mind to Murder in Honour of the
King: how many there were 'tis hard to say,
the highest Account gives 90, the lowest 50,
the middle 70; the Blacks do not understand
Arithmetick, so the Numbers they give in
all Cases are very uncertain. I think there
were about Eight from this Town, which
will not hold Proportion to the highest rate;
but 'tis like near <em>Feton</em> there might be more.
They say also, that many more will follow at
half a Years distance from his Death. The
manner of the Execution of these poor Creatures
I have not yet learnt, only that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
make them drink and dance, with a great deal
of Bravery all the begining of the Day, and
towards Night cut off their Heads, but whether
by that they mean the common way of
their Executions I am yet to seek.</p>

<p>After the Kings Funeral, the next thing
was to chuse a Successor; so the People was
called together at <em>Feton</em>, (I suppose by the
Authority of the Dy) without inquiring any
thing of their Freehold; they pitched upon
Mr. <em>Dy</em>, though he was not of the Blood-Royal;
the Reason was, as they said, because
he had Power enough to do what he
pleas'd, and they could do nothing against
him; but he refused the Honour because of
the Charge 'twould put him to, and propos'd
the Brother of the deceased King: So the
Business stuck some time, but at last 'twas
accorded, and he [King <em>Ashrive</em>'s Brother]
declared King, <em>Nov. 18.</em> his Name is <em>Ahenaco</em>.</p>

<p>'Tis Wonder how they could dispatch such
a Business, with so little Disturbance; but I
suppose there was no considerable Number
that dissented; otherwise it would scarce
have been determined without Blood-shed;
for it would scarce have been possible for them
to have taken any Pole.</p>

<p>I said it was doubt whether these Sacrifices
died after the rate of their ordinary Executions;
if you would know that, thus it is,
the Creature that is condemn'd, is made to
drink abundance of Palm-Wine, and to dance,
every Body that will, in the mean time striking
or pushing him, when that is over, as is
said, he is thrown down, his Face into the
Sand, which whether it stifle him or not, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
can't tell, then his Legs are cut off below the
Knees, and his Arms below the Elbow, afterward
his Thigh and his Arms below the Shoulder,
lastly his Head.</p>

<p>A Man would not expect any thing more
barbarous than this; yet there is a Custom
which has something worse; when any one has
new Drums or Trumpets, 'tis necessary that
they be consecrated with Humane Blood: I
have known but one happen of this Kind,
that was <em>Jan. 7. 1686/7.</em> when after the Man
had been executed after the former rate, about
Eight in the Morning; at one in the
Afternoon, they drank Palm-Wine out of the
upper part of his Skull, and this in the sight
of all the Factors at <em>Cape Corse</em>.</p>

<p>I remember for the Unhealthiness of the
Place, you proposed to inquire if it were
Woody, and if any good might be done to
it by cutting down the Woods, as has happen'd
in many <em>American</em> Plantations; of that
Matter this is what I can say.</p>

<p>The Shore lies almost East and West, expos'd
to the Sea wholly upon the South, the
Country is Hilly, the Hills not very high,
but thick, clustering together, the Valleys
between extream narrow, the whole in a
manner cover'd with certain Shrubs, low, but
very thick; what the People Till, comes not
to above a Tenth part of their Ground; and
where they do Till, it hinders not that within
half a Year the Ground is over-grown as
before, for they do not root up the Shrubs,
but only cut, or sometimes burn them somewhat
close to the Earth, so they spring again
in a very little time; this is sufficient for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
their planting the Corn, which they do by
making little Holes in the Earth at a competent
Distance, and putting Seeds into
them.</p>

<p>It may be that if those Shrubs were destroyed,
the Matter might be mended, which
yet is not to be hop'd for, but by bringing
the People to some kind of Industry, and
that will not be easie; they are so wholly
given to Laziness, and so intirely bred up in
it, that there must be the greatest Change
imaginable, before they become any whit tolerable;
a Man may see their Temper by this,
that though their Tillage be very easie, and
the Earth yields many Hundreds for One, yet
so little is the use they make of it, that One
scarce Year brings them to danger of Starving,
and though there be People enough, and
every Man has Power of choosing what he
will, that is not already Till'd by some other,
yet not the Tenth Part, as we have said, is
employed: So that a Man would wonder what
came in the French Man's Head to fancy them
Industrious; but subtile they are, and diligent
to Cheat any Man that is not cautious enough
to avoid it.</p>

<p>So that the Fault of the Wood is (by the
Laziness of the People) without any Remedy.
But there may be something in the Earth it
self; the Water which they have here in Pits
(Rain-Water for the most part, but yet strain'd
through the Earth) has a kind of Taste mixt
of Sweet and Subacid, if I understand what
I say, I am told 'tis of Vitriol, whether
that be mischievous, you know better than
I do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
But I take this for certain, since I have had
it from good Hands, that at <em>Widdah</em>, which
is one of the most unhealthy Places in <em>Guiney</em>,
but 'tis not upon the Gold-coast, he that
opens the Ground, though it be but to dig a
Grave, runs the Hazard of his Life: So mischievous
are the Steams from thence arising.
It's possible there may be some such Steams
here, only not so violent; though in <em>England</em>
I think, a Gravel or a Sand (which here are
always uppermost for as much as I have seen)
are esteem'd very wholesom Soils; under
them is a kind of whitish Marle almost like
Fullers-Earth.</p>

<p>For the Air, except what I have said before,
I do not know what Fault it has; 'tis
extream hot, 'tis also subtile and piercing,
and I believe enters a Man's Body easier than
that in <em>England</em>. It has been clearer than that
uses to be one day with another, even this
last Year, which has been the wettest and most
cloudy which has happen'd a long time; I
think to give you an Account of the Weather
in it as soon as I have time to transcribe.</p>

<p>For the Age of the Inhabitants, 'tis very
uncertain, because none of them keep an Account
of it; there are some of them very
Grey, but if the Country be to them unhealthy,
Grey Hairs may come early: I think
there be many more Funerals here than at
<em>Oxford</em>, though that be a much larger Place,
especially in the Rain-times, which to us are
always healthful.</p>

<p>I think that much of the Mortality (not
all) that happens among Strangers, is the
Effect of their ill Diet, and ill Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
of themselves; for they eat but little, having
neither Stomach nor Mony to buy what
they want; but they drink excessively, being
for that more readily trusted, and of Liquors
very hot and Spirituous; and if any
chuse the cold rather, his Stomach is chil'd,
and he is in danger of a Flux or an extream
Looseness, and that immediately.</p>

<p>There is another thing, Men guard themselves
less from the Air than in any other
Places trusting to the Heat of the Climate,
and receive the cool of the Evening with only
a Shirt. Now I think that the Air, tho'
not so cold, is much more subtle and piercing
here, than in our Country, it corrodes Iron
much more, not by the Moisture, for it is
not so moist, and besides it does it in the dry
Weather too. Perhaps there are some other
Effects to evidence the same thing; besides
that, the Diet which most Men procure, is
not extraordinary, and the passing by Canoes
from one Place to another has a Danger in
it beside that of the Sea.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="right"><em>Cape Corse, Apr. 25. 1688.</em></p>

<p>I Promised in my last to give you an Account
of the Weather at <em>Cape Corse</em> for
the last Year, which Account I have inclosed
in this; it is as exact as I could give; 'tis a
thing which has been very little observed,
whether it deserves to be more, I do not
know. That Year has had the most Rain of
any that can be here remember'd; yet the
Mortality was much less than the Years before;
so that perhaps Wet is not that which
makes the Country unhealthy; though we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
had very many Sick, especially in <em>June</em> and
<em>July</em>, whose Diseases were not Mortal.</p>

<p>If you give your self the Trouble to read
the inclosed, you will find often mention of a
Tornada, which is a violent Storm of Wind,
followed commonly by Rain, but not always;
the Wind ceases not presently upon the Rain,
but after sometimes it does: In this Place it
comes (as does an Hermitan) most frequently
from the North, taking in the next Points,
whether to the East or West, but chiefly the
East, though I have seen both that and an
Hermitan from other Points; so the Account
is not without Exception; there are in it short,
uncertain Blasts from all Quarters, which I
believe reach not many Yards, but the general
Wind (for ought that I see) is not so
unconstant; Vessels that go to Windward
are help'd by them, when they are not over
strong, for they are opposite to the Sea Breze,
and they can steer by them a regular Course;
which sure they could not do, if they were
very irregular. They never fail to give warning
before hand, though sometimes after that
warning they do not follow; there is a very
black Cloud appears afar, in which if there
be a kind of white Spot, the Wind will be
moist, if not the Rain; this the Sailors say.
Sometimes there is that Mark, sometimes not,
though I doubt the Prediction from it is not
very certain; as neither are any perhaps of
that kind.</p>

<h2><em>An Account of the <strong>Moorish</strong> Way
of Dressing their Meat (with
other Remarks) in <strong>West-Barbary</strong>,
from Cape <strong>Spartel</strong> to Cape
<strong>de Geer</strong>. <strong>By Mr.</strong> Jezreel Jones.</em></h2>


<p>The <em>Mauritanian</em> or <em>Barbarian Moor</em>,
when he rises in the Morning, washes
himself all over, and dresses, then goes to
their <em>Jiama</em>, or Church, says his Prayers,
and returns home, where his Wife, Concubine,
or Slave, hath his Breakfast provided
for him, which is sometimes made of Barly
or Wheat-Gruel; for I have known both.
It is made somewhat thicker than ours, till it
be ropy; they put Origan, and other Herbs,
powder'd, into it, which for such uses they
keep dry'd all the Year; some will put a little
Pepper, and other Spice. I have often
been treated with warm Bread, fresh Butter,
and Honey, in a Morning, which is not seldom
used among themselves, an Hour or two
after they have had Gruel; as also Hasty-Pudding,
with Butter, and sometimes Butter
and Honey, (as the Guests are, and according
to the Ability of the Entertainers.) Some
again give <em>Cuscusoo</em>, with Milk, others with
Flesh, a third with Roots. It is to be observed,
when any one hath a Guest or Guests in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
his House, the Neighbours bring their Dish
to welcome him or them, on account of the
Respect and Love they bear to their Neighbour,
as well as to shew their Readiness to
entertain the Stranger. This Practice is
found constantly used throughout the whole
Country among the <em>Moors</em>, one towards another,
reciprocally. And I have as often found
the like Civility, as I had occasion to take up
my Lodging at any Place, where I was acquainted
with any of the Inhabitants. The
<em>Jews</em> likewise shew great Civility to any <em>Christian</em>,
and treat him with what they have, as
stew'd or bak'd Hens, Capons, hard Eggs,
boil'd or roasted, which they press flat with
Pepper, and Salt, Wine, Brandy, <em>&amp;c.</em> They
have generally the best Bread, and every thing
else of the kind that they can get. They put
Annis, and two or three other sorts of Seeds,
in their Bread; one is black and angled, tastes
almost like Carrot-seeds, and I think I have
seen these sometimes used in Bread in <em>Spain</em>;
I know not the Names of the other Seeds in
<em>English</em>, nor any Language but <em>Arabick</em>. They
esteem Honey as a wholsome Breakfast, and
the most delicious that which is in the Comb,
with the young Bees in it, before they come
out of their Cases, whilst they still look Milk-white,
and resemble (being taken out) Gentles,
such as Fishers use: These I have often
eat of, but they seem'd insipid to my Palate,
and sometimes I found they gave me the
Heart-burn.</p>

<p>In <em>Suse</em> I had a Bag of Honey brought by
a Friend who made a Present of it, as being
of great Esteem, and such as they present to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
Men of greatest Note among them. This,
he told me, I was to eat a little of every
Morning, to the quantity of a Walnut; it
was thick as <em>Venice</em> Treacle, and full of small
Seeds. I used to breakfast on it for several
Days together, taking the said quantity at a
time; it always made me sleepy, but I found
my self well, and in very good temper of Body
after it. The Seeds were about the bigness
of Mustard, and, according to the Description
of them to me, and the Effects I
found by eating the Honey and them, they
must be a large sort of Poppy-seed. The
Honey was of that sort they call in <em>Suse</em>, <em>Izucanee</em>,
or <em>Origanum</em>, which (the Bees feed on)
and these Seeds were mixed with.</p>

<p><em>Cuscus</em>, or <em>Cusksoo</em>, is the principal Dish among
them, as the <em>Olla</em> is in <em>Spain</em>: This is
made of Flower of Wheat, and when that is
scarce, of Barley, Millet, <em>Indian</em> Corn, <em>&amp;c.</em>
They shake some Flower into an earthen Pan,
made on Purpose, which is not glazed, sprinkling
a little Water on the bottom of the Pan
first, and then working it with both their
open Hands flat, turning them backwards and
forwards to grain it, 'till they make it much resembling
<em>Sago</em>, which comes from the <em>East-Indies</em>.
They stew their Flesh keeping their
Pots close covered, which are made of Earth,
put the <em>Cusksoo</em> into an earthen Cullender,
which they call <em>Caskass</em>, B. <em>vid.</em> Fig. and this
Cullender into the Mouth of the Pot, C. that
so all the Steam which arises from the Meat
may be imbibed by the <em>Cusksoo</em>, which causes
it to swell, and make it fit to be eaten: When
it is enough, for they love every thing tho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>roughly
done, they put this <em>Cusksoo</em> out into
the Dish they serve it up in, which is somewhat
like D. and the <em>Cusksoo</em> being heaped up,
they make (as it were) a Bed or Place for
the Meat to lie in, then they put good store
of Spice, as Ginger, Pepper, Saffron, <em>&amp;c.</em>
This Dish is set upon a Mat on the Ground,
and four Men may easily sit about it, tho' I
have seen six and more at one Dish; they sit
with their Buttocks upon the Calves of their
Legs, with the bottom of their Feet on the
Ground. If there are many to eat at this
Meal, there are more Dishes. This Dish they
have in use sometimes at Breakfast, as well as
Dinner and Supper, but it is commonly used
for the two last Meals. They cover it with
a thing made on purpose, somewhat like E.
and it will keep hot enough two Hours. At
a stately Entertainment they will have a Sheep
roasted whole, sometimes a half, or a quarter,
on a wooden Spit, or the most convenient
thing they can find. They do not continually
keep turning it, as we do, but leisurely
let one side be almost roasted before they
turn the other. The Fire is commonly of
Wood burnt to clear Coal, and made so, that
the Heat ascends to the Meat. They baste
it with Oil, and a little Water and Salt incorporated.
They let it be thoroughly roasted;
then they say, <em>Bismiillah</em>, <em>In the Name of God</em>,
after they have washed their Right Hands,
and pulling the Meat in pieces, they fall to
eating. It is to be noted, that they never
use but their Right Hand in eating, and one
holds whilst the other pulls it asunder, distributing
the pieces to the rest, as he pulls it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
off. They seldom use a Knife, and a Fork
is a strange thing among them. They are
dextrous at this way of carving, and never
flinch at the Heat or warmth, for that would
look mean, and might occasion one more bold
to take his Office upon him to perform.
When they have done, they lick their Fingers,
and as often as they have a hot Dish,
they wash their Hands afresh. Then they
have <em>Alfdoush</em>, or <em>Virmizzelli</em>, with some Meat
on it, stew'd Meat, well spiced, with savoury
Broth; which after they have eat the
Meat, they dip their Bread in the Sauce, or
Broth, and eat it. They are cleanly in their
Cookery, and if a Hair be found it is a capital
Crime, but a Fly not, because it has
Wings, and may get in after it passes from
the Cook's Charge or Management; to be
well and strongly season'd is no great Fault;
and if one should say it is too high of Pepper,
they'll reply, it is better to be <em>Ah</em> than <em>Faugh</em>;
alluding to the Differences between a strong,
high, or hot, and savoury Taste, and an insipid,
watry, or unpleasant. <em>Cubbob</em> is small
pieces of Mutton, with the Caul of a Sheep
wrapped on them. Some make good <em>Cubbob</em>
of the Liver, Lights, and Heart. They Pepper
and Salt them, and put Sweet Herbs and
Saffron into them, and then roast them, and
when they dish them up, squeeze an Orange
or two on them. Thus they use commonly
in their stew'd Meats, Lemon and Orange
for Roast or Fish.</p>

<p><em>Elmorosia</em> is another: This is pieces of Beef,
of Cow or Camel, stew'd with Butter, Honey,
and Water; some will put <em>Rob</em> of Wine among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
it; they add Saffron, Garlick, or Onions, a
little Salt, and when 'tis enough, serve it
up. They esteem this a delicious Dish, used
mostly in the Winter, and say it is good against
Colds, notwithstanding they say Beef
is cooler than Mutton. They have a piece
of good Housewifery for a ready Dish, which
is likewise appropriated to the Winter Season;
and this I will give an Account of before
I have done. Then they will treat you
with Hare stew'd, stew'd and roasted Hens
and Partridges: These they disjoint, and let
stew in Water, and Oil, or Butter, if they
are not fat enough of themselves. When
they are almost enough, they beat a couple
of Eggs, mix them with the Liquor, with
Juice of Lemon or Vinegar, which they usually
have very good, and serve it up.</p>

<p>Then you may have more baked and roast,
and another Dish of stew'd Meat, which for
its Goodness would be esteem'd among us:
They take a Leg of Mutton, cut off the
fleshy part, leave out the Skin and Sinews.
This Flesh they mince very fine (with two
Knives, one in each Hand) by holding them
across, which they manage with great Dexterity;
they also mince some Suet, Parsly,
Thime, Mint, <em>&amp;c.</em> Then they take Pepper,
Salt, and Saffron beaten together, and some
Nutmeg; all these they add to the rest, with
about half a handful of Rice; they cut an
Onion, of the best sort, half through, and
take off the first Lay, as not so fit for use,
unless it be thick. (They that are curious
take out the inner Skin, saying it is not
wholsome, and bad for the Eyes, it being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
the worst thing in an Onion, which otherwise
would be the best of Roots.) This Lay
they fill with forc'd Meat, then the next, and
so on, which makes them look like so many
Onions; some they put up in Vine-leaves of
the best they can find for their purpose.
Whilst this is doing, the Bones and Residue
of the Leg of Mutton, being in moderate
pieces, are stewing, with as much Water
as will just cover them; then they put on
their forc'd Meat-Balls a top of the Meat,
and a green Bunch of Grapes upon them,
cover it, and let it boil till thoroughly enough.
This I think, is one of their best
Dishes, which they often use in <em>Fess</em> and other
Cities. <em>Pillowe</em>, or <em>Piloe</em>, is a Dish very well
known, made with Rice boil'd, with a good
Hen, Mutton, and Spice, the Flesh and
Fowl being put on the Rice in a Dish as <em>Cusksoo</em>,
and so served up.</p>

<p>A Bustard, which they roast and stew, and
make an excellent Dish of its Guts, I eat
of it once; to me it seemed very pleasant
and savoury, and very grateful to the Stomach.
This Bird is fit for their King's Table,
as likewise the Hedgehog, of which I will
give an Account anon. Then they have
<em>Ragous</em>, made with Sparrows, Pidgeons, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p>Their Drink is plain Water, or Milk, and
sometimes <em>Rob</em> of Wine mixed with Water.
I was once treated with this by the Bashaw of
<em>Suse</em>, <em>Abdolmeleck ben Alchotib</em>, and there was
brought to me a great Bowl which held above
three Quarts; he told me there was not above
half a Pint of this <em>Rob</em> in it, and the rest was
filled up with Water. It was very generous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
and pleasant, and tho' I did not drink a quarter
of it, yet I found the Strength in half an
Hour. This they say is a Remedy against
Cold likewise, and pretend to take it medicinally;
tho' <em>Rob</em> of Grapes is lawful
according to their<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>Law. Under
this Pretext, many <em>Fessee</em> Merchants,
to make <em>Rob</em>, or Vinegar, press all the Grapes
in their Vineyards, put it up in great Jars,
under Ground, and keep it long, so that it
proves excellent Wine. When four or five
merry Companions, with every one his Mistress,
appoint to be merry, they go out to
their Vineyard or Garden, have Musick, and
all or most of these Dishes, and there sit and
carouse over a great earthen Bowl full of Wine,
of about four or five Gallons, and so drink
round in a Cup that will hold almost a Pint,
like a large Tea Dish, till there is none left;
it often happens that they do not part till
they have made an end of the whole Jar,
which seldom is less than a Weeks time. I
have known some that have been nine Days
successively drunk; those that are known to
drink Wine or Piss standing, their Testimony
will not be valid in Law.</p>

<p>In a Morning, during this time of Merriment,
they are for some savoury Bit, <em>Pickled
Fish</em>, or <em>Escaveche</em>, or <em>Elcholle</em>. They are
great Lovers of Fish, and have as great Variety
and very good, which they fry in <em>Organ
Oil</em>, stew, roast, and bake, with good store
of Spice, Onions, Garlick, Cummin, Parsly,
and Coriander. The <em>Escaveche</em>, or fry'd Fish,
is cut in thin slices, and put into Vinegar,
with the aforesaid Spices, adding Saffron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
and Pepper, <em>&amp;c.</em> It will keep above a Month,
and this they have commonly, as also pickled
Limes, Olives, Capers, <em>&amp;c.</em> They eat parched
<em>Garavancas</em>, parched Almonds, and Beans,
which they parch in a Pan with Water and
Salt. These, and other things, they have
to relish their Glass of Wine, or give them
a fresh Appetite to drink. They say, to cure
the ill Effects of a drunken Bout, is, to take
a swinging Cup of the same Liquor, which
invites them to more, and so on.</p>

<p>But I have left some Dishes, by this Digression,
to give an Account of their extravagant
Mirth.</p>

<p>The Hedgehog is a princely Dish among
them, and before they kill him rub his Back
against the Ground, by holding its Feet betwixt
two, as Men do a Saw that saws Stones,
till it has done Squeaking; then they cut its
Throat, and with a Knife cut off all its Spines
and singe it. They take out its Guts, stuff
the Body with some Rice, sweet Herbs, Garavancas,
Spice, and Onions; they put some
Butter and Garavancas into the Water they
stew it in, and let it stew in a little Pot,
close stopped, till it is enough, and it proves
an excellent Dish. The <em>Moors</em> do not care
to kill Lamb, Veal, nor Kid, saying it is a
Pity to part the Suckling from its Dam.
They eat with their boil'd Meat, many times
Carrots, Turnips of two or three sorts, Cabbage,
Beans, and Pease, <em>&amp;c.</em> which they have
plenty, and very good. I have eat of Porcupine
stewed, which much resembled Camels
Flesh in Tast, and that is the nearest to Beef
of any thing I know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p>I come now to give an Account of the
<em>Alcholea</em>: It is made of Beef, Mutton, or
Camel's Flesh, but chiefly Beef, which they
cut all in long slices, salt it well, and let it
lie twenty four Hours in the Pickle. Then
they remove out of those Tubs, or Jars, into
others with Water, and when it has lain
a Night, they take it out, and put it on
Ropes in the Sun and Air to dry; when it
is thoroughly dri'd, and hard, they cut it into
pieces of two or three Inches long, and
throw it into a Pan, or Chauldron, which is
ready, with boiling Oil and Suet sufficient
to hold it, where it boils till it be very clear
and red, if one cuts it, which, taken out,
they set to drain: When all is thus done, it
stands till cool, and Jars are prepared to pot
it up in, pouring the Liquor they fried it in
upon it, and as soon as it is thoroughly cold
they stop it up close. It will keep two Years,
it will be hard, and the hardest they look on
to be best done. This they dish up cold,
sometimes fry'd with Eggs and Garlick, sometimes
stew'd, and Lemon squeezed on it.
It is very good any way, either hot or
cold.</p>

<p>Before I conclude, I willingly give an Account
of their Travelling-Provision, <em>viz.</em>
Bread, Almonds, Raisons, Figs, hard Eggs,
cold Fowl, <em>&amp;c.</em> But what is most used by
Travellers, is <em>Zumeet</em>, <em>Tumeet</em>, or Flower of
parched Barley for <em>Limereece</em>. These are not
<em>Arabian</em> but <em>Shilha</em> Names, so I believe it is
of a longer standing than the <em>Mahometans</em> in
that Part of <em>Africk</em>. They are all three
made of parched Barley Flower, which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
carry in a Leather Satchel. <em>Zumeet</em> is the
Flower mixed with Honey, Butter, and Spice;
<em>Tumeet</em> is the same Flower done up with <em>Organ
Oil</em>; and <em>Limereece</em> is only mixed with
Water, and so drank: This quenches Thirst
much better than Water alone, satisfies a
hungry Appetite, cools and refreshes tired
and weary'd Spirits, overcoming those ill Effects
a hot Sun and fatiguing Journey might
occasion. This among the Mountaineers of
<em>Suse</em> is used for their Diet as well at home as
on their Journey. All things taken in Game,
as Hawking, Hunting, and Fowling, are
lawful for them to eat, if they take it before
it be dead, so that they can have time to cut
its Throat, and say, <em>Bismiillahe</em>; or if he is
known to be an expert Man at the Game,
and says those Words before he lets the Hawk
take its Flight, lets slip the Grey-hound, or
fires his Gun, it is lawful; all (I say, but
Swine's Flesh, and what dies of its self) they
have Liberty to eat, and may sell it. They
tell us there is but one Part about the Hog
or Swine that is unlawful, which they do
not know, and are obliged to abstain from
the whole; but if they knew it, they would
let us have but little to our share. They
eat Snails boil'd with Salt, and praise their
Wholesomeness. Fish of all sorts, are lawful.
In <em>Taffilet</em> and <em>Dra</em> most of their Food
is Dates, there are ten or a dozen sorts.
They have good Capons all the Country over;
no Turkeys, Ducks, nor Geese but wild, and
those they have of two sorts; Duck, Teal,
and Mallard, Curlews, Plovers, Snipes, Ox-birds,
Pipers, a sort of a black Crow, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
a bald Pate, and long crooked Bill, is good
Meat, and a hundred other sort of Fowl. I
have eat Antelope, which we have kill'd in
hunting, and are very good Food. They
are as large as a Goat, of a Chestnut Colour,
and white under the Belly; their Horns are
almost quite streight from their Head up,
tapering gradually, with Rings at a distance
from one another, till within an Inch and a
half of the top; fine large black Eyes, long
and slender Neck, Feet, Legs, and Body,
shaped somewhat like a Deer; they have two
Cavities between their Legs, I think the Male
as well as the Female. I have sent of these
Antelopes alive to <em>England</em>. There are many
in a Herd, when at the same time they have
Scouts, or those who by running give 'em
notice of an approaching Foe. When two
lie down together, they lay themselves so,
that their Backs are towards each other, and
the Head of one towards the Tail of the
other, that they may see every way. Their
Dung is sweet and pleasant enough. They
are taken sometimes by the Hawk, sometimes
by the Shot; for they are too swift
for a Grey-hound. Partridges in <em>Sus</em> commonly
roost on Trees; there are so many
Foxes which would otherwise destroy them.</p>

<p>And here I should make mention of another
Dish: The <em>Moors</em> will eat Fox, if it
be Fat, either stewed or roasted, but they
do not care for it lean, which has occasioned
a Proverb among them on that Account,
to wit, <em>Hellel deeb, harom deeb</em>; alluding
to the Scruple might be made of its
lawfulness. Those Words signifie, a Fox
is lawful, and a Fox is unlawful; <em>i. e.</em> Fat,
Lawful; Lean, Unlawful.</p>

<h2><em>A Letter from Mr. <strong>John Monro</strong>
to the Publisher, concerning the
Catacombs of <strong>Rome</strong> and <strong>Naples</strong>.</em></h2>


<p>
<em>SIR,</em><br />
</p>

<p>The Catacombs are an obscure Argument.
I have seen those of <em>Rome</em>, I
have seen those of <em>Naples</em>, and as they say
there are Catacombs in the Neighbourhood
of all the great Towns of that part of <em>Italy</em>,
I had been glad to have seen them where-ever
they are. They are an obscure argument
indeed; but perhaps the greatest obscurity
about them is, that a Matter that
has so much exercis'd the Pens of the Moderns,
shou'd be totally neglected by the Ancients:
Neither the name nor the thing is found in
the latter, whereas among the former, Antiquaries
and Travellers are full of them. All
they into whose way they come, think they
do nothing if they do not exhaust them before
they leave them; they take all their dimensions,
and measure their height, their
breadth and their length; they survey all the
little Rooms, search every hole and corner,
Criticize nicely on the quality, and calculate
the Age of the poor Painting and Inscriptions,
and make excursions into other Arguments,
to find out the end for which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
were made. The Catacombs are a narrow
Gallery dug and carried a vast way under
Ground, with an infinite number of others
going off it on all hands, and an infinite
number of little Rooms going off the Principal,
and them too. Those commonly
shew'd Strangers are those of <em>San Sebastiano</em>,
those of <em>San Lorenzo</em>, those of <em>San Agnese</em>,
and the others in the Fields a little off of
<em>Sant Agnese</em>. They take their Names from
the Churches in their Neighbourhood, and
seem to divide the circumference of the City
without the Walls between them, extending
their Galleries every where under, and a vast
way from it, so that all the Ground under,
and for many Miles about it, is said to be
hollow. Now there are two sorts of Authors
that run into extravagance on this subject;
the one will have them made by the
Primitive Christians, adding, that in the
times of Persecution they liv'd, held their
Assemblies, and laid up the Bodies of their
Martyrs and Confessors in them. This is
the Account that prevails at <em>Rome</em>, and consequent
to it there are Men kept constantly
at Work in them. As soon as these Labourers
discover a Repository, with any of the
marks of a Saint about it, Intimation is given
to the Cardinal Treasurer, who immediately
sends Men of Probity and Reputation
to the place, where they find a Palm
painted or ingraven, or the Cypher XP,
which is commonly read <em>pro Christo</em>, or a
small round projection in the side of the Gallery,
a little below the Repository; what is
within it is carried to the Palace. Many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
these Projections we have seen open, with
pieces of the Vials in them; the Glass indeed
was tinctur'd, and 'tis pretended that
in these Vials was conserved the Blood of
the Martyrs, which was thus laid up nigh
their Bodies, towards the Head, to distinguish
them from those of the others that
were not called to the Honour of laying
down their Lives for the Faith of the Gospel.
After the Labourers have survey'd a
Gallery, they do up the entry that leads into
it; thus most of them are shut; nor are
more left open than what is necessary to keep
up the Trade of shewing them to Strangers,
which they say is done to prevent what has
often happen'd, I mean Peoples losing themselves
in these subterraneous Labyrinths; by
this conduct depriving us of the means of
knowing whither and how far they were carried.
To this it may be justly excepted,
that allowing the Catacombs to be proper
for the end for which they are presum'd to
be made, and that the Christians of that
Age were in a capacity of making that convenience,
for themselves to live and assemble
in below Ground, at a time when 'twas so
very unsafe to appear above it; yet to suppose
that a work of that Vastness and
Importance cou'd be carried on without the
knowledge of the Government, is to suppose
the Government asleep, and that that was
actually done under its Nose, that must necessarily
have alarm'd it, had it been attempted
on the frontiers of the Empire.</p>

<p>The other sort of Authors give indeed a
mighty Idea of the Catacombs, represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
them as a work of that Vastness, that the
Christians in the persecuting times had not
number enough to carry it on; but then
most unadvisedly with the same breath they
confound them with the <em>Puticuli in Festus Pompeius</em>,
where, at the same time that the Ancient
<em>Romans</em> us'd to burn the Bodies of their
dead, the custom was, to avoid expence, to
throw those of the Slaves to rot.</p>

<p>This is not all, the <em>Roman</em> Christians, say
they, observing at length the great veneration
that certain Places gain'd by the presence
of Relicts, resolv'd to provide a stock for
themselves; entring therefore the Catacombs,
they made in some of them what Cyphers,
what Inscriptions, what Painting they
thought fit, and then shut them up; intending
to open them again upon a Dream, or some
other important incident. The few that
were in the secret of this Artifice either dying,
or as the Monks, who were the only
Men that seem to have had Heads adapted
to a thought of this quality, were subject to
so many removes, being transported to other
Places, the contrivance came to be forgot,
and those Galleries continu'd shut, till Chance,
the Parent often of great discoveries, open'd
them at last. Thus they conclude, the
Remains of the vilest part of Mankind are
trump'd up in the Church for the Bodies of
the most eminent Confessors and Martyrs.</p>

<p>To leave the latter part of this Tale to
shift for it self as well as it can, either the
Catacombs are not that great work they are
represented to be, nor to be found every where
about the City, or 'twas very improper in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
<em>Festus Pompeius</em> to call them by the little name
of <em>Puticuli</em>, and so confine them to one place
only, that I mean unknown now without the
<em>Esquilin</em>-Gate. Indeed the Characters of the
Places are so very unlike, that one wou'd
wonder how a common Burying place, where
in holes Bodies were thrown together to rot,
came to be confounded with Repositories
cut in the face of a long Gallery, one over
another, sometimes to the number of seven,
in which Bodies were singly laid, and handsomly
done up again, so that nothing cou'd
offend the view of those that went in, especially
with the little Rooms of the fashion of
Chappels, that have all the Appearances of
being the Sepulchers of People of distinction.</p>

<p>The Remark, <em>Puticulos Antiquissimum sepulturæ
genus appellatos, quod ibi in puteis sepirentur
homines</em>, is that of an Etymologist,
that would be now thought to speak against
all the property of Language, if he apply'd
the name to our Graves or Vaults, to which
it may with more Justice and Reason be apply'd,
than to the Galleries of the Catacombs, and
the Rooms that go off them. What the particulars
were is not difficult to define, after
what we have seen so often. When the Persecutors
spilt the Blood of so many Martyrs,
they us'd to dig holes perpendicularly in the
Ground, and to throw their Bodies promiscuously
in them; of this the Memory is still
conserv'd, Churches being built in the Places
where the holes were made, and little Monuments
erected over the holes themselves,
to which the name of <em>Putei</em> is continued to
this day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the true notion of the <em>Puticuli</em>,
holes dug perpendicularly in the Ground to
throw Bodies indifferently and without any
decency in; and according to the Argument
this ought to be the conduct of the Ancient
<em>Romans</em>, with Respect to their Slaves,
as implying simplicity and the care to avoid
a greater expence; but then what's all this
to the Galleries and Chambers of the Catacombs,
where decency and distinction of
quality is nicely observ'd; and that, if they
were look'd after, and kept in better repair,
would be without dispute the noblest Burying-place
this Day in the World? As often as
they fall under my consideration, I cannot
forbear thinking they were made for this end
by the Ancient <em>Romans</em>, and made in consequence
of these two Ancient opinions, that
the shadows hate the light, and love to hover
about the place where the Bodies are laid, they
appear so easie and decent a resting-place for
the one, without the least fear of being ever
disturb'd, and at the same time there is provided
a noble and a vast convenience full of
variety for the others, to space themselves
freely and with pleasure in.</p>

<p>I think 'twill not be denied, that laying up the
Bodies in Caves was the original way of disposing
of the dead; this was that of the
<em>Phænicians</em>, and as they were the Men that
with their Colonies peopled the Western parts
of the World, 'tis more than probable they
carried it along with them whither soever
they went. Afterwards, as Men grew great
and powerful, they erected noble and magnificent
Monuments for themselves above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
ground; at length others of inferior degree
imitated them, all leaving room enough and
excluding the light: But then interring as
we do now in the open Air, or in Temples,
was never the manner till Christianity brought
it in. Of the whole we have many Instances,
and <em>Il Signior Abbate Bencini</em>, Bibliothecary
of the <em>Propaganda</em>, a Gentleman of good Ancient
Learning, assured me in the conversation
I had with him on this Argument, that
on the great Roads in most parts of <em>Italy</em> little
Catacombs have been and are still found
under ground, and that 'twas the Custom to
build little Houses over them. This, and
the testimony of the Labourers whom I consulted
on the matter, made me abandon an
opinion of which I was once fond, that the
Catacombs are of the Nature of our Gravel-pits,
as old as the City itself, and yet out
of them was taken the <em>Puzzolana</em>, the famous
Ingredient in the <em>Roman</em> Mortar. The same
learned Gentleman added, relating to the
marks of a Martyr, that they don't conclude
much; that the so fam'd Cypher XP was in
use among the Ancients long before Christianity
begun: And when I ask'd him what
the meaning of it might be among them?
return'd, that 'twas compos'd of the two
<em>Greek</em> Letters Χ Ρ, under which something
mystical was comprehended, but that he met
with no Author that gave account what the
mystery was.</p>

<p>Thus, after a multitude of thoughts about
the Catacombs, I'm forced to take up with
this; so natural it is, arising from the sole Theory
of the Place, and falls in so oppositely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
with the Religion and Practice of the Ancients,
among whom the <em>Dii Manes</em> were the
Tutelary Gods of the Country, and <em>D. M.</em>
at the head of an Inscription, argues the
Moles, the Sepulchre, the Monument, <em>&amp;c.</em>
was in the primary intention made for and
dedicated to the Soul. Upon the same Maxims,
in Foreign expeditions, when a Hero
died or was kill'd, as the Body was liable to
a quick corruption, and for that Reason unfit
to be transported entire, they fell on the
expedient of Burning, in order to bring home
the Ashes, to oblige the <em>Manes</em> to follow,
that so the Country might not be deprived
of the Benefit of its tutelage. This I humbly
conceive was the Original of Burning,
which by Degrees became more and more
universal, till at last the Pomp and Magnificence
of it reconcil'd it to all that were able
to go to the length of the expence.</p>

<p>As for the prejudice of the Silence of the
Ancient Authors in this matter, 'tis easily
removed, and to be regretted at the same time
that the Authors of all Ages, too much neglect
the customs of their own time. Writing
for the satisfaction of their Cotemporaries,
they think it impertinent to Trouble them
with the Account of what they see Transacted
every Day. By this means the Ancient
Customs, with the Time, and Reasons of their
disuse, are lost with Respect to us, and ours
with the same Circumstances may come to be
so with relation to Posterity. As the Authors
are pleas'd to adopt them for their
Children, one wou'd wonder greater care is
not taken not to entail visible occasions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
complaint on them; nay, one wou'd wonder
more, to see these Gentlemen so little ambitious
of a future reputation, when they may
infallibly assure it themselves, without resigning
the present, by transmitting the knowledge
of things, the knowledge of which
may in a small series of Years become otherwise
irretrievable; they cannot but observe
every Day what esteem is placed on those
Authors, to whom we are forced to go, to
find in them what cannot be found elsewhere,
to compare with the others, in whom nothing
is to be found, but what Men of Reason
are able to find at home.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the Catacombs I humbly
conceive were the Burying-places of the Ancient
<em>Romans</em>; at length the manner of Burning,
which they received from the <em>Græcians</em>,
coming by degrees to prevail universally,
they fell under a total neglect. This is the
State in which the Primitive Christians must
be suppos'd to have found them; 'tis not to
be imagin'd they could have made any use
of them, at a time when 'twas the daily practice
to lay up even the depositions of the
Slaves in them; so that either the Christians
made no use of them at all, or they never
were the burying Place of the Slaves. Now
as these are Suppositions that naturally destroy
one another, one would count it more safe to
follow the faint light of a glimmering tradition,
than abandon ones self to the Conduct
of an <em>Ignis fatuus</em>, that for ought a Man knows
is actually misleading him, so I beg leave to
call the Testimony of <em>Festus Pompeius</em>, that
may rather be apply'd to any other thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
than to the Galleries of the Catacombs,
carry'd under ground, they say 20 Miles
from the City in some places, and no Body
knows how far in others, and to that vast
number of Chambers that go off them. Thus
therefore the Christians finding them in a
state of neglect laid up the Bodies of their
Dead in them; and perhaps when the Persecution
was hot, conceal'd themselves and
kept little separate Assemblies in their Chambers.
At last the Empire turning Christians,
they fell again in the old state of neglect, in
which they continu'd till upon the reading of
I have forgot what Author that makes mention
of them, they came to be look'd into
and search'd. What I have writ relates to
the Catacombs of <em>Rome</em>, those of <em>Naples</em> are
a quite other thing, of which <em>per</em> next. I am,</p>

<h2><em>An accurate Description of the <strong>Lake
of Geneva</strong>, not long since made
by a Person that had visited it
divers times in the pleasantest
season of the Year; and communicated
to the Publisher by
one of his Parisian Correspondents:
English'd as followeth.</em></h2>


<p>You have reason, <em>Sir</em>, to demand of
me an Account of the <em>Lake of Geneva</em>,
which, in my opinion, about this Season of
the Year (in <em>June</em>) is one of the most pleasant
Places of the World. This is the Third
time I have visited it, and I am, if I may say
so, more charmed with it than the first.</p>

<p>I shall say nothing of the <em>Alpes</em>, nor of
mount <em>Jura</em>, which do environ it, which by
this Lake as by a large Ditch, are separated
from one another: For that would not give
you a sufficiently fair <em>Idea</em> of the Country.
Be pleased therefore to represent unto your
self a Croissant of Water, one extremity
whereof is Eighteen Leagues distant from the
other, and the Banks of which are gently
raised to some heights, then to collines, and
at length to stupendous Mountains; which
yet are not so linked to one another but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
that they leave betwixt them interstices of
Fifteen or Twenty Leagues prospects, checkered
by Meadows, Corn-Fields, Orchards,
Vines, Forrests of Fir-Trees, Snow lying on
the sides of the Rocks. All these Objects,
which at a distance are confounded, and
seem to make but one, have near hand their
several Beauties: So well is the Country intersected
by Rivulets, which, after they have
served to make Iron, Paper, &amp;c.; run into
the Lake, carrying with them very many
Fountains.</p>

<p>But leaving these Things, I shall now content
my self to entertain your Curiosity by
giving you a candid Relation of what I have
there observed in the space of Four Months.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although I have told you, that this Lake
hath the figure of a <em>Croissant</em>, yet that point,
where is <em>Geneva</em>, is somewhat longer and
more extended than the other. This Croissant
where 'tis largest, which is from <em>Morges</em>
to <em>Thonon</em>, is about Five good Leagues
over. That which hinders from making an
exact estimate of its Largeness in other places,
is, that the Winds by driving the Water
toward the Banks have made certain points,
which advance far into the Lake, in such
sort that when one happens to be opposite to
the other, the Lake seems to be narrow:
As may be observed in going from <em>Geneva</em> to
<em>Nion</em>, where it seems as if the <em>Pharus</em> or
watch Tower of <em>Prangin</em>, which is in <em>Suisse</em>,
did almost touch <em>Savoy</em>; whereas yet one is
a League distant from the other. And, what
is remarkable, is, that at the coming out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
this Streight, the Lake hath there almost its
greatest breadth and depth.</p>

<p>The Water of this Lake is very good to
drink, and ever so limpid, that even in the
rolling of the Waves, which sometimes go
high enough, the Water is not troubled but
along the Banks. And if one do attentively
look down from the Castle of <em>Chilon</em> or from
any of the neighbouring heights into the
bottom of the Lake, he may see high Mountains
under the Water. And the Water is
so Deep before <em>Veuvay</em>, that the sounding
Line at the end of four hundred Fathoms
seems, because it will not stay, to Touch
upon something slippery. 'Tis held to be
500 Fathoms deep before <em>Roole</em>; and 'tis affirm'd,
that near this great Depth there may
be seen a kind of <em>Isle</em> under Water.</p>

<p>The <em>Rhone</em> enters at one of the Points of
the Croissant into the Lake, and issueth out
at the other; but with this Difference, that
whereas he comes in Dirty and Miry, he ever
goes out so Pure and Clear, that under the
Bridge of <em>Geneva</em>, where the Water is deep
twenty five Feet in Summer, you may well
discern the smallest Stones at the bottom.
And the same Water, which in this Place appears
of a Saphyring Blew in the shade of the
Houses, appears altogether Green, nor is so
Transparent, when the Sun shines on it.</p>

<p>There is a great diversity of Opinions as
to the <em>Current</em> of the <em>Rhone</em> in the Lake; some
maintaining, that it may be discerned, others
denying it. Having heard the Sentiments
of the Curious of <em>Lausanne</em> and <em>Geneva</em>, and
the Opinions of the most knowing Fisher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>men
that are there in great Number, and especially
at <em>Coupet</em>, I believe with the latter;
that, although the <em>Rhone</em> entring into the
Lake loseth its Violence, yet doth he still
keep some sensible Motion in some places,
and every were observable, and that no Trouts
are taken any were in this Lake, but in this
Current of the <em>Rhone</em>; which is what these
Fishermen call, to go and Fish <em>sur le mont</em>.</p>

<p>Others there are, that go further and say,
that one may every where distinguish the
Water of the Lake from that of the <em>Rhone</em>:
But the Fishermen will not allow this, but
assert, that there is no other Mark than those
lately alledged, <em>viz.</em> of the Trouts, and the
Current; and that the latter of these is
alone sufficient, in calm Weather, to observe
the Current of the <em>Rhone</em> from the place of
his entring the Lake unto that of his going
out.</p>

<p>The Water of this Lake commonly begins
to Increase about the end of <em>January</em>, or the
beginning of <em>February</em>, and continues to do
so unto the twentieth of <em>July</em>, and often unto
the very Month of <em>August</em>; and then it
insensibly decreaseth, so that the Water is
less high in Winter than Summer by twelve
or fifteen Feet; the Frosts draining the
Springs, or rather Freezing the Waters that
issue out of them.</p>

<p>About this Increase of the Water there
are also different Opinions. 'Tis true, they
all believe in general, that the principal
cause of the Increase of the Water is the
melting of the Snow, and of the Mountainous
Ice, that is in the Winter form'd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
the Waters of the Springs and Torrents,
which the Frost fixeth. This is so true, that
when there is much Snow in Winter, the
Waters are very high the ensuing Summer.
But when great Rains chance to fall in <em>January</em>,
then the Snow, not yet being well hardened,
melteth on a sudden altogether. And
when this melting is not so violent, all the
Snow that will melt, melts at the end of
<em>May</em> or at the beginning of <em>June</em>; so that,
there remaining but the stock of Ice for entertaining
the Increase of the Water unto
the Month of <em>August</em>, some have thence
been induced to say, that this Increase, which
amounts, as has been said, to 15 Feet Water
generally all over the Lake, is caused by
the Herbs, growing, as they pretend, at its
bottom in great abundance; and that these
Herbs, whilst growing, do force the Water
upwards, and dying in Autumn make the
Water to sink lower. Which is not satisfactory
to me, because there are no Herbs seen
upon the Lake, and very little within it, and
the Banks being very dry.</p>

<p>Others there are, that will have this Water
rarified by the Heat of the Sun, and
thereupon swell'd on the Borders, hot Water
not being so high in the middle as cold.</p>

<p>This is certain, that all the Rivers and
Torrents, that fall into this Lake, carry
with them store of Stones and Earth, which
may indeed enlarge and raise it: But such an
augmentation or rise cannot be sensible but
from Age to Age; not to mention, that in
Winter, whilst the Water is low, the Stones
of the Lakes are carried away for building or
fortifying at <em>Geneva</em>.</p>

<p>At the issuing out of the Barres, that form
<em>Geneva</em>, on the side of the Lake, are seen in
the Water two or three huge Flints, standing
out of the Water; the chief of which they
call <em>Niton</em>: And the Tradition is, that it
formerly was an Altar consecrated to <em>Neptune</em>;
there being also a place cut out in the
middle, which they take to have been the
place for the Sacrifice. On this Flint seven
or eight Persons can sit; and sometimes,
when the Waters are very low, there are
found about it Knives, and Needles as thick
as Bodkins of tweeses, and much longer;
both of Brass, well enough made, and esteemed
to have served for the Sacrifices.</p>

<p>This Lake in serene and calm Weather
appears sometimes, and that even before Sun-rising,
as if it were made of divers pieces,
differently coloured; part of it being Browner
than the rest, which seems to be caused by
a Breath of Wind passing thorough the Water,
coming either from the bottom of the
Lake, or from above; tho' others think this
gentle agitation to proceed from some Springs
that are at the bottom, making the Water
shiver above. But that part of the Water,
that is not moved, appears as even and smooth
as a Looking-Glass, or like Water traced by
a Ship. And as for the Colours, they are,
in my Opinion, an effect of the neighbouring
Mountains, the different Images of which,
being confounded in the Water, make an appearance
of very pale Colours.</p>

<p>After that the <em>Rhone</em> is entred into the
Lake, he retakes not his impetuous course
before a quarter of a Mile's distance from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
coming forth again, that is, above <em>Geneva</em>.
And the nearer he comes to that Town, the
more his Bed becomes narrow, and consequently
his course more Rapid. Yet this
Rapidness hath been in our times once surmounted
by Wind, and once by Water. To
understand which, you may imagine, that in
<em>Geneva</em> there is a streak of Land about an
hundred Fathoms long, which divides the
<em>Rhone</em> into two parts, passing under four
Bridges, then covered with Houses. From
the Point of this Isle unto several ranks of
Stakes on that side of the Town, there are
about a Thousand common Paces. This
whole space of Water, which makes the figure
of an V (whereof the Isle is the Point,
and the Town forms the sides, and the Stakes
the empty place of the end) hath been once
laid dry by a violent Wind, after this manner.
One Day in the Winter of the Year
1645. there arose in the Morning about 9
a clock so furious a Wind, that not only it
uncovered the Houses, but also laid dry the
Bed of the <em>Rhone</em> above the Bridges, so that
many, in the view of all the Town crossed
quite over it dry-foot, and one of the Sons
of M. <em>D. Aubigny</em> took up some Medals,
which he found in his way. This passage was
free during an Hours time; at the end of
which the River retook its course. At that
Season the Water being very low, and a
West-Wind, to arrive at <em>Geneva</em>, being pressed
by the high Mountains that bring it upon
the Town as by the nose of a pair of Bellows;
it came to pass, that that Wind did
violently bear upon the Water near the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
Bars keeping suspended the Water that was
beyond, and those Waters, that were beneath,
running away downwards by a declivity, and
under the shelter of the Houses. Whilst I
was scrupling at this Relation, they brought
me <em>Gallasius</em> his Commentary upon <em>Exodus</em>,
Printed 1560. where 'tis recorded, that the
like accident had fallen out at <em>Geneva</em> at the
time when that Minister lived there, a South
West Wind having made the <em>Rhone</em> to recoil
into the Lake, and many People having
thereupon passed over dry for an Hours
time.</p>

<p>Concerning the other Accident; you may
remember, that the River <em>Arve</em>, which is a
kind of Torrent falls into the <em>Rhone</em>, about
a 1000 Paces beneath <em>Geneva</em>. In the Month
of <em>December</em> in the Year 1652. the said <em>Arve</em>
did so extraordinarily swell, that not only it
over-run its Banks with impetuosity, but also
interrupted the course of the <em>Rhone</em>, and
forc'd it to re-enter into the Lake for the
space of fourteen hours; though some do
esteem, that the <em>Arve</em> dis-gorged it self for
that time into the Lake, by passing <em>over</em> the
Water of the <em>Rhone</em>, which, in their Opinion,
continued his course under the Water of
the <em>Arve</em>. However the Water was seen at
<em>Geneva</em> to re-enter into the Lake.</p>

<p>But to conclude, this Lake doth very much
abound in Fish; but that which is observable
is, that those Fishes have as 'twere cantonized
themselves, and divided the Lake among
them. The <em>Trouts</em> are not to be found there,
but, as hath been already mentioned, in the
Current of the <em>Rhone</em>: The <em>Carps</em> have ta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>ken
up their quarter towards <em>Veuvay</em>: The
<em>Pikes</em> and <em>Pearches</em> have also their Habitations
apart. But some other Fish, that are but Passengers,
not living constantly in the Lake,
spread themselves almost every where indifferently.</p>

<p>The great Trouts pass out of the Lake for
four Months of the Summer, and are taken
in Autumn when they are returning thither.
The Fishing is farmed out at <em>Geneva</em>; and
there are Conservatories where many of those
big Trouts are kept, among which there are
some that weigh fifty pounds. Sometimes
they catch Pikes there of eighty pounds
weight; and a pound weight at <em>Geneva</em> you
know to be eighteen Ounces.</p>

<p>In the Months of <em>July</em> and <em>August</em> they
fish there for the Fry of Pearches, at a time
when they are no bigger than the smallest
Taggs. These are a very delicious Dish, there
called <em>Mille Cantons</em>.</p>

<p>I shall add no more than put you in mind of
that Duke of <em>Savoy</em>, who renounced his Crown
and the Pontificat it self, to pass deliciously
the rest of his Days at <em>Ripialles</em>, where he
made so good cheer to all that visited him,
that to express a very merry Entertainment,
they say still, <em>faire Ripialles</em>.</p>

<h2><em>Part of a Journal kept from <strong>Scotland</strong>
to <strong>New Caledonia</strong> in <strong>Darien</strong>,
with a short Account of
that Country. Communicated by
Dr. <strong>Wallace</strong>, F. R. S.</em></h2>


<p><em>September 2.</em> we weighed at <em>Maderas</em>, and
were under the Tropic of <em>Cancer</em> by the
10th of the Month, at which time the usual
Ceremony of Ducking from the Yards-arm
was performed on those that could not pay
their Tropick Bottle. All this time we had
a brisk and constant Trade-wind, which lasted
three days more, but afterwards we had
it more variable than is usual in that place
of the Sea.</p>

<p>The 28th we made <em>Deseada</em>, a small high
Island, about a league in length and as much
in breadth; it is full of Trees, but whether
it affords Water or not I know not. It is
uninhabited. Next morning we were betwixt
<em>Antego</em> and <em>Montserat</em>, belonging to
the <em>English</em>, both pretty large and mountainous.
<em>Antego</em> is Peopled with <em>English</em> for the
most part, and <em>Montserat</em> by a mixture of
<em>English</em> and <em>Irish</em>. Their Product is Sugar
and Tobacco. We were in the afternoon
close by <em>Redonda</em>, a small Rock about a mile
long, inhabited only by Noddies and Boobies.
When we were some leagues from <em>Redonda</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
we saw at the same time <em>Antego</em>, <em>Montserat</em>,
<em>Redonda</em>, <em>Nevis</em>, <em>St. Christophers</em>, and <em>Statia</em>.
We sailed close by <em>Nevis</em>, it bearing North
of us; it is a small well Peopled Island, its
Product is Sugar. They twisted the Flag at
the Harbour, and we shew'd them the Company's
Colours. <em>St. Christophers</em> is a large
Island, ill Peopled, belongs half to the <em>English</em>,
half to the <em>French</em>. Night parted us
from these Islands, and next day, which was
the 30th, we came in sight of <em>Santa Cruz</em>,
belonging to the <em>Spaniards</em>. When we were
within four leagues they held a Council. The
<em>Unicorn</em> and <em>Snow</em> were sent to St. <em>Thomas</em>, a
small Island belonging to the <em>Danes</em>; it is a
free Port, and they say is well fortified. We
went on to the Southward of the Island, and
next Day, being <em>October 1.</em> we were about
12 a clock past the S. W. corner. It is very
level towards the South. That Night we
got a sight of <em>Crab Island</em>, and next Day</p>

<p><em>October 2.</em> we came into it, and sent some
of our People ashore, and took possession of
it in the Companies name. <em>October</em> the 4th
we stood to the Leeward, hearing there was
a Harbour there; when we came we saw the
<em>Danes</em> Colours flying on the Shore, for the
Governour of St. <em>Thomas</em> had sent 14 Men
and a Captain to take possession of it in the
King of <em>Denmark</em>'s name. Our Councellors
sent to know his Business there, and he told
them this, but we found that we had taken
possession of the Place before they came from
St. <em>Thomas</em>. They gave in their Protest, yet
seem'd to be glad enough of our Neighbourhood.
We had notwithstanding our Flag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
upon the Shore all the while we stay'd, with
100 Men, and Captain <em>Melean</em> Governour;
they stayed till we were gone, but would
certainly March next Day, otherwise the
<em>Spaniards</em> of <em>Porto Rico</em> would not miss to take
them off.</p>

<p>The 6th, Captain <em>Pinkerton</em> and the <em>Snow</em>
came in from St. <em>Thomas</em>, with old Captain
<em>Alison</em> along with them for a Pilot. On the
8th we left this place, and on the 17th made
<em>Nostra Signiora della Popa</em>, we lay aside there
along the Coast, until the 3d Day of <em>November</em>,
generally losing by Night what we had
gain'd all Day.</p>

<p><em>Crab Island</em> is about 6 Leagues long, and in
some places 5 broad, the Soil is very good.
It's all full of Trees; all the South side is
full of Bays, very fit for anchoring in, but
the best of all is to the Leeward, where the
<em>Dane</em> hoised his Colours. It would have been
worth our while to possess it, had we not
been a coming to a better Country. It has
this Inconvenience, that nothing but strength
of Men, or Peace with every Body, can render
it secure. It is called <em>Crab Island</em>, from
the multitude of Land-Crabs there.</p>

<p><em>November 3.</em> We anchored before <em>Golden
Island</em>, and sent in our Pinnace to the Bay.
The Natives had hoised a White Flag in
sign of Peace, and told us a great many Stories
of Captain <em>Swan</em>, Captain <em>Davies</em>, and
others, for they took us for <em>English</em>, by reason
of our red Fly; but we took no notice
of the Men they nam'd. At last they ask'd
us our Business? we told them we designed to
settle among them, and to be their Friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
They told us we were very welcome, and
that by prediction they had expected us these
two Years; for they say that two Years ago
it was foretold them that a People should come
and live among them, that would treat them
civilly, and teach them good manners. We
conversed some time with them, and after
viewing the Harbour came aboard.</p>

<p>The 4th we came into the great Harbour
of <em>Caledonia</em>: It is a most excellent one, for
it is about a League in length from N. W. to
S. E. It is about half a Mile broad at the
Mouth, and in some places a Mile and more
farther in. It is large enough to contain 500
sail of Ships. The greatest part of it is
Land-lock'd, so that it is safe, and cannot
be toucht by any Wind that can blow the
Harbour, and the Sea makes the Land that
lies betwixt them a Peninsula. There is a
Point of the Peninsula at the Mouth of the
Harbour, that may be fortified against
a Navy. This Point secures the Harbour,
so that no Ship can enter but must be within
reach of their Guns. It likewise defends
half of the Peninsula, for no Guns from the
other side of the Harbour can touch it, and
no Ship carrying Guns dare enter for the
Breast-work at the Point. The other side of
the Peninsula is either a Precipice, or defended
against Ships by Shoals and Breaches,
so that there remains only the narrow Neck
that is not naturally fortify'd; and if 30
Leagues of a Wilderness will not do that, it
may be artificially fortified 20 ways. In short,
it may be made impregnable, and there is
Bounds enough within it, if it were all cultivated,
to afford 10000 Hogsheads of Sugar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
every Year. The Soil is rich, the Air good
and temperate, the Water is sweet, and every
thing contributes to make it healthful
and convenient. The Product of this Place,
I mean in the Harbour and Creeks hereabouts,
is Turtle, Manatee, and a vast variety of
very good small Fish, from the bigness of a
Salmon to that of a Perch. The Land affords
Monkeys of different sorts, Wild-Deer,
<em>Indian</em> Rabbit, Wild Hog, Parrots of many
kinds, Parakites, Macaws, Pelicans, and
a hundred more Birds we have got no name
to. There are moreover Land-Crabs, Souldiers,
Land-Turtle, Lizards, Guanha's, Cock-Lizards,
and Scorpions: I had almost forgot
Partridges, Pheasants, and a kind of Turkey.
All the Birds in this Country are beautiful,
but none of them that I could observe have
any Notes. We have a Monkey aboard that
chirms like a Lark, it will never be bigger
than a Rat. This Place affords legions of
monstrous Plants, enough to confound all the
Methods of Botany ever hitherto thought
upon. However, I found a shift to make
some Specimens, and that is all I can do. I
say some Specimens, because if I should gather
all, 'twould be enough to load the St.
<em>Andrew</em>, for some of their Leaves exceed
three Ells in length, and are very broad;
besides these Monsters, reducible to no Tribe,
there are here a great many of the <em>European</em>
kindred, (but still something odd about them)
as <em>Lingua Cervina</em> of different kinds, <em>Filix</em> of
different kinds, <em>Polypodium</em>, several of the
<em>Plantæ Papilonaceæ</em>, <em>Musci</em>, <em>Fungi</em>, <em>Convolvuli</em>,
and a great many more I cannot now remember.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
Now come we to their People. The Men
are generally very Civil and Sagacious, have
all of them good Faces, are of low stature,
but very well built; they are of a Copper
Colour, and have black Hair; they us'd to
go naked, but are now as well Cloath'd as
our selves; they wear a Plate of Gold in their
Nose, and a great many rows of Beads about
their Neck and Wrists. They cover their
Yard with a piece of Bark, or sometimes
Silver, of the very shape and bigness of that
Paper-case we use to put a dose of Pills in;
they seem to be very ill furnish'd, for I never
saw any of them have it half an Inch long,
yet no doubt it's longer, but I fancy they
sheath it up, as Dogs and Horses do. The
Women are generally the most pitiful like
things that ever Man saw; their Habit differs
from the Men, for they ordinarily wear
a Ring in their Nose; they have Petticoats
and a Veil over their Face. They are under
no formal Government, but every Captain
commands his own River, Bay or Island,
where he lives; the greatest of them all is
one Captain <em>Ambrosio</em>, he commands particularly
the Country about the <em>Samballoes</em> Point,
but when he pleases he can Levy all the
Men betwixt that and the Gulf about 20
Leagues. There is another Captain <em>Pedro</em>,
that lives in the House with <em>Ambrosio</em>, and
is his Nephew and Son in Law; there is a 3d
Captain <em>Andreas</em> that commands the River
<em>Das armas</em>; a 4th Captain <em>Brandy</em>, that commands
about the <em>Golden Island</em>; a 5th Captain
<em>Andreas</em>, that commands the Country adjoining
to our Settlement; and a 6th Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
<em>Pedro</em> his Consort; a 7th Captain <em>Pacigo</em>,
who commands at <em>Carret Bay</em>, and Captain
<em>Diego</em> that commands the Gulph. <em>Ambrosio</em>
seems to be the greatest, and <em>Diego</em> next,
both old Men; they are all very much our
Friends, and fond of us. All have been
frequently here except Captain <em>Diego</em> who is
Goutish. Some of these Captains wear the
<em>Scots</em> Flag in their Canoa's. There is no
such thing as a King or Emperor of <em>Darien</em>,
nor, so far as we can gather from all the
chief Men hereabout, has been these 40 or
50 Years: The old Men remember such a
Man, they say he was a Tyrant, would take
as many Wives as he pleased, and allow them
but one, and therefore they cut him off.
This derogates much from the reputation
of the <em>History of the Buccaneers</em>. If there
were such a Man, he has been an <em>Indian</em> made
Emperor by themselves, I mean by the <em>Buccaneers</em>.
This Country certainly affords Gold
enough, for besides that the Natives constantly
assure us, that they know several
Gold Mines on this side; besides that, I say,
the Plates they wear in their Noses, and the
quantity of Gold that is among them, is enough
to perswade any Man of the truth of
it. There was one Night aboard here some
<em>Indians</em> that had a hundred Ounces of Gold
about them. We are certainly much bound
to Providence in this affair; for as we were
searching for the place we were directed to,
we found this, and though the Privateers had
been so often at <em>Golden Island</em>, and though
<em>English</em>, <em>Dutch</em> and <em>French</em> had been all over
this Coast, from <em>Portobelo</em> to <em>Cartegena</em>, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
never one of them made the discovery;
even the <em>Spaniards</em> themselves never knew of
this place. Besides, for as great a secret as
we thought the Project, it was known all
the <em>West Indies</em> over, and yet it was not in
their power to crush it. At <em>Madera</em> they
seem'd to know it, at St. <em>Thomas</em> I'm sure they
knew it; at <em>Portobelo</em> their Intelligence was
so good, that they knew the names of all our
Councellors and Captains of Ships before we
landed, and had that particular observation,
that there were four <em>Roberts</em> among them.
Our circumstances are in some Respects very
good, for we have advice by the way of <em>Portobelo</em>,
that there is a great Rebellion in
<em>Mexico</em>, and Captain <em>Diego</em> and all the <em>Indians</em>
about him are at present at War with the
<em>Spaniards</em>. Captain <em>Ambrosio</em> is going to his
assistance, and that will divert them on that
side; but which is better than all, that we
are now in a posture of defence against all the
<em>Spanish</em> force in <em>America</em>. I have seen already
<em>Dutch</em>, <em>French</em>, and <em>English</em> all at the same
time in our Harbour, and all of them wonder
what the rest of the World have been
thinking on, when we came hither to the best
Harbour of <em>America</em>, in the best place of it.
Captain <em>Long</em> came in eight days after, and I
believe we were a great Eye-sore to him,
tho' he said nothing. He commanded the
<em>Rupert Prize</em>, a small <em>English</em> Man of War,
fitted out by the King, upon what design we
know not, but he pretends it was to search
for a Silver Wreck; he was on this coast a
Month before sounding it; and conversing
with the Natives, he put ashore Men in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
places, to take possession for the King of
<em>Great Britain</em>, but none of them within 15
Leagues of us. Hearing by the Natives that
we were here, he came in with his Long-Boat,
as he said to see us, but I believe it was only to
know the certainty of what he feared was
too true. He had told all the <em>Indian</em> Captains
that he came only to try their inclinations,
and that there was a great Fleet coming
with a great many People to settle among
them, and defend them against their enemies,
he meant <em>English</em> that were to come by his direction;
but our Fleet coming within a Month
after, they all lookt upon us to be the People
he spoke of; so that whatever Presents he
made them before that time, was as much
for our Advantage as if our selves had given
them. He pretends to be a Conjurer, and
to foretel things; but that was the truest
Prophecy ever he spoke, though he knew not
whom he spoke of.</p>

<h2><em>A DISCOURSE tending to
prove at what <strong>Time</strong> and <strong>Place</strong>,
<strong>Julius Cesar</strong> made his first Descent
upon <strong>Britain</strong>: Read before
the <strong>Royal Society</strong> by <strong>E.
Halley</strong>.</em></h2>


<p>Though <em>Chronological</em> and <em>Historical</em> Matters,
may not seem so properly the Subject
of these Tracts, yet there having, in one
of the late Meetings of the <em>Royal Society</em>,
been some Discourse about the Place where
<em>Julius Cesar</em> Landed in <em>Britain</em>, and it having
been required of me to shew the Reason why
I concluded it to have been in the <em>Downs</em>; in
doing thereof, I have had the good Fortune
so far to please those worthy Patrons of Learning
I have the Honour to serve, that they
thought fit to command it to be inserted in
the <em>Philosophical Transactions</em>, as an instance of
the great Use of <em>Astronomical Computation</em> for
fixing and ascertaining the Times of memorable
Actions, when omitted or not duly
delivered by the Historian.</p>

<p>1. The Authors that mention this Expedition
with any Circumstances, are <em>Cæsar</em> in his
<em>Commentaries</em> <em>lib.</em> 4, and <em>Dion Cassius</em> in <em>lib.</em> 39;
<em>Livy</em>'s account being lost, in whose 105<em>th.</em>
Book might possibly have been found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
Story more at large. It is certain that this
Expedition of <em>Cæsars</em>, was in the Year of the
<em>Consulate</em> of <em>Pompey</em> and <em>Crassus</em>, which was in
the Year of <em>Rome</em> 699. or the 55<em>th</em> before
the usual Æra of Christ: And as to the time
of the Year, <em>Cæsar</em> says that <em>Exigua parte æstatis
reliqua</em>, he came over only with two Legions,
<em>viz.</em> the 7<em>th</em> and 10<em>th</em> and all Foot, in
about 80 Sail of Merchant Ships, 18 Sail
that were ordered to carry the Horse not
being able to get out at the same time from
another Port, where they lay Wind-bound.
He says that he arrived about the 4th hour of
the Day, <em>viz.</em> between Nine and Ten in the
Morning, on the Coast of <em>Britain</em>, where he
found the Enemy drawn up on the <em>Cliffs</em> ready
to repel him, which place he thus describes.
<em>Loci hæc erat natura, adeo montibus augustis mare
continebatur ut ex locis superioribus in littus
telum adjicit possit</em>, by which the <em>Cliffs</em> of <em>Dover</em>
and the <em>South Foreland</em> are justly described,
and could be no other Land, being he says in
the 5<em>th</em> Book of his Commentaries, <em>in Britanniam
trajectum esse cognoverit circitur millium
passum triginta à continenti</em>, the <em>Cliffs</em> of the
<em>North-Foreland</em> being at a much greater distance.
Here he says he came to an Anchor,
and staid till the 9<em>th</em> hour, or till about
between Three and Four in the Afternoon,
expecting till his whole Fleet was come up;
and in the mean time called a Council of
War, and advertised his Officers, after what
manner they were to make their Descent,
particularly in relation to the Stuff of the
Sea, whose motion he calls <em>celerem atq. instabilem</em>,
quick and uneven. Then, <em>viz.</em> about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
Three in the Afternoon he weighed Anchor,
and having gotten the <em>Wind</em> and <em>Tide</em> with him,
he Sail'd about Eight Miles from the first
place, and Anchor'd against an open and plain
Shore.</p>

<p>2. Here he made his Descent, and having
told us the opposition that was made, and the
means he used to get on Shore, he comes to
say, that after he had been <em>Four Days</em> in <em>Britain</em>,
the 18 Ships with his Horse put to Sea,
and were come in sight of his Camp, when
a suddain Tempest arose, with contrary
Wind, so that some of the Ships put back
again, others were driven to the Westwards,
not without great danger, and coming to
Anchor, they found they could not ride it
out: so when Night came on, they put off
to Sea and returned from whence they came.
<em>That same Night</em> it was <em>Full-Moon</em>, which
makes the greatest Tides in the Ocean, and
they being ignorant thereof, their Gallies,
which were drawn on Shore, were filled by
the Tide, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p>3. Then he says that the Day of the Autumnal
Equinox being at hand, after some
Days stay, wherein there passed no Action
because he kept close in his Camp by the
shore; and not thinking it proper to stay till
the Winter came on, he returned into <em>Gallia</em>:
The next Year he made a further Expedition
with 5 Legions and a good Body of Horse,
but there is but little in the History thereof
serving to our purpose, excepting that he
says he set Sail from the <em>Portus Icius</em> about Sun
Set, with a gentle S. W. Wind, <em>leni Africo
profectus</em>; that about Midnight it fell Calm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
and being carried away with the Tide, by
the time it was Day, he found he had left
<em>Britain</em> on the left hand; but then the Tide
turning they fell to their Oars, and by Noon
reached that part of the Island where he
Landed before, and came on Shore without
opposition: and then March'd up into the
Country, leaving his Ships at Anchor <em>in littora
molli &amp; aperto</em>.</p>

<p>4. This is all in <em>Cæsar</em> that is any thing
pertinent, and I find no where else any thing
to guide us farther, except one passage in <em>Dion
Cassius</em>, who speaking of the first Landing
of <em>Cæsar</em>, says οὐ μέντοι καὶ ᾗ ἔδει προσέσχεν, that is,
as I Translate it. But he Landed not where
he intended, for that the <em>Britains</em> hearing of
his coming, had possest all usual Places of
Landing Ἄκραν οὖν τινὰ προέχουσαν περιπλεύσας ἑτέρωσε
παρεκομίσθη. Κἀνταῦθα τοὺς προσμίξαντάς οἱ ἐς τὰ τενάγη
ἀποβαίνοντι νικήσας, ἔφθη τῆς γῆς κρατήσας, in my
English. Wherefore doubling a certain head
Land, he made to the Shore on the other side,
where he overcame those that Skirmished
with him at the Waters edg, and so got well
on Land. Here I make bold to translate the
Words ἐς τὰ τενάγη, <em>at the water edge</em>, which
in <em>H. Stephens</em> Edition is interpreted <em>in paludibus</em>,
but I have the Authority of <em>Suidas</em>,
who says τέναγος, πελαγία ἰλὺς, or the Sea
Mud, and is therefore properly the Ouse on
the Sea Shore, and by an easie Figure may
be put for the Shore it self, where such Ouse
commonly is found.</p>

<p>5. From these <em>data</em>, That it was in the
Year of the <em>Consulate</em> of <em>Pompey</em>, and <em>Crassus</em>;
That it was <em>Exigua parte æstatis reliqua</em>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
Four Days before a Full-Moon, which fell
out in the Night time. The time of this Invasion
will be determined to a Day: For by
the Eclipse of the Moon, whereof <em>Drusus</em>
made so good use to quiet a Mutiny in the
<em>Pannonian</em> Army, upon the News of the Death
of <em>Augustus</em>, it follows that <em>Augustus</em> Died <em>Anno
Christi</em> 14. which was reckoned <em>Anno Vrbis
conditæ</em> 767. and that this Action was 68
Years before, <em>viz.</em> in the 55<em>th</em> Year before
Christ Current. In which Year the Full Moon
fell out <em>August 30.</em> after Midnight, or 31 in
the Morning before Day; and the preceeding
Full-Moon, was <em>August 1.</em> soon after
Noon; so that this could not be the Full-Moon
mentioned, as falling in the Day time:
nor that in the beginning of <em>July</em>, it being
not 10 Days after the Summer solstice, when
it would not have been said <em>exigua parte æstatis
reliqua</em>. It follows therefore that the Full-Moon
spoken of, was on <em>August 30.</em> at Night,
and that the Landing on <em>Britain</em> was <em>August
26.</em> in the Afternoon, about a Month before
the Autumnal equinox; which agrees to all
the Circumstances of the Story in point of
Time.</p>

<p>6. As to the Place, the high Land and
Cliffs described, could be no other than those
of <em>Dover</em>, and are allowed to have been so
by all, it remains only to examine whether
the Descent was made to the Northward or
Southward of the place where he first Anchored.
The <em>data</em> to determine this are first
that it was Four Days before the Full-Moon.
2. That that Day by Three of the Clock in
the Afternoon the Tide ran the same way he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
Sail'd. 3<em>dly.</em> That a S. by E. Moon makes
High-Water on all that Coast, the Flood
coming from the Southward: hence it will
follow, that that Day it was High-Water
there about Eight in the Morning, and consequently
Low-Water about Two, wherefore
by Three the Tide of Flood was well made
up, and it is plain that <em>Cæsar</em> went with it,
and the Flood setting to the Northward
shews that the open plain Shore where he
Landed was to the Northward of the Cliffs,
and must be in the <em>Downs</em>; and this I take to
be little less than Demonstration. A second
Argument is drawn from the Wind wherewith
he set out on his second Expedition, <em>viz.</em> S.
W. as appears by the Words <em>leni Africo profectus</em>,
with which the Navigation of those
times would hardly permit a Ship to Sail nearer
the Wind than Eight Points, or a N. W.
Course; which would serve indeed to go
into the <em>Downs</em>, but would by no means fetch
the Low-land towards <em>Dengyness</em>, which is
much about West from <em>Calais</em>, and not more
than W. N. W. from <em>Boulogne</em>, if it shall be
said that that was the <em>Portus Icius</em> from which
<em>Cæsar</em> set out. Whence I take it to be evident
that if <em>Cæsar</em> was not bound more Northerly
than the <em>South-Foreland</em>, he could not have
thought the <em>Africus</em> or S. W. Wind proper for
his passage, which was then intended for the
place where he first Landed the year before.</p>

<p>7. Justly to determine which the <em>Portus Icius</em>
was I find no where sufficient grounds; only
<em>Ptolemy</em> calls the Promontory of <em>Calais-Cliffs</em>
by the name of Ἴκιον ἄκρον, whence there is
reason to conjecture, that the <em>Portus Icius</em> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
very near thereto, and that it was either <em>Ambletuse</em>
on one side, or <em>Calais</em> on the other.
The same <em>Ptolemy</em> places Γισοῤῥίακον ἐπίνειον in
the same Latitude with the ἴκιον ἄκρον, but
something more to the East, which seems to
refute those that have supposed the Ancient
Port of <em>Gessoriacum</em> to have been <em>Boulogne</em>,
whereas by <em>Ptolemy</em>'s position, it must be either
<em>Dunkirk</em> or <em>Graveling</em>, but the former most
likely, both by the distance from the Ἴκιον
ἄκρον, being about 20 Miles or half a degree
of Longitude to the East, or ⅔ of the whole
Coast of <em>Flanders</em>, which he makes but a degree
and quarter from the <em>Acron Icion</em> to the
mouth of the <em>Scheld</em> which he calls <em>Ostia Tabudæ</em>:
As also for that <em>Pliny</em> l. 4. c. 16. speaking
of <em>Gessoriacum</em>, says the <em>Proximus Trajectus</em>
into <em>Britain</em> from thence is 50 Miles, which
is too much unless <em>Gessoriacum</em> were something
more Easterly than <em>Calais</em>. <em>Dion Cassius</em> makes
the distance between <em>France</em> and <em>Britain</em> 450
<em>stadia</em> or 56 Miles, and says likewise 'tis the
nearest, τὸ Συντομώτατον. But this is in part
amended by the explication given in the <em>Itinerary</em>
of <em>Antoninus</em>, where the space between
<em>Gessacorum</em> and <em>Rutupium</em> is said to be 450 <em>stadia</em>
(for this was the ordinary passage of the <em>Romans</em>
into <em>Britain</em>,) <em>Rutupium</em> being more
Northerly and <em>Gessoriacum</em> more Easterly than
the <em>termini</em> of <em>Cæsars</em> Voyage, and consequently
the distance greater than 30 Miles which <em>Cæsar</em>
had observ'd; and now lately an accurate Survey
has proved the distance between Land and
Land to be 26 <em>English Miles</em> or 28½ <em>Roman Miles</em>,
which shews how near <em>Cæsars</em> estimate was to
the Truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span></p>

<p>A farther Argument (but not of equal force
with the former because of the modernness of
the Author, who writ above 250 Years after)
may be drawn from the words of <em>Dion Cassius</em>,
where he says ἄκραν τινὰ προέχουσαν περιπλεύσας ἑτέρωσε
παρεκομίσθη, that after his first Anchoring
he Sail'd about a Promontory to the place
where he Landed: Now there are no other
Promontories on all that Coast but the <em>South-Foreland</em>
and <em>Dengyness</em>; the latter of which
it could not be, because <em>Cæsar</em> says he Sail'd
but 8 Miles, and the <em>Ness</em> it self is about 10
Miles from the South and nearest end of the
<em>Chalk-Cliffs</em> by the Town of <em>Hith</em>; and to
have gone round that Point to the other side,
the distance must have been much greater.
So that the Promontory spoken of by <em>Dion</em>,
must needs be the <em>South-Foreland</em>, and <em>Cæsar</em>
must Anchor near over against <em>Dover</em>, from
whence Sailing 8 Miles, he would double a
Head-land and come to the <em>Downs</em>; which
is such a Coast as he describes in one place
by <em>apertum ac planum littus</em>, and in his 5<em>th</em>
Book by <em>molle ac apertum littus</em>. As to <em>Dions</em>
word εἰς τὰ τενάγη, what I have already said
about it seems sufficient to prove that he
means no more than the Waters edg; and
the <em>Etymologists</em> derive it from τέγγω <em>madefacio</em>,
because the wash and breach of the Sea does
always keep it wet. And this word τὰ τενάγη
is used by <em>Polybius</em> for the Sea Ouse;
and in another place he speaks of the difficulty
of Landing at the mouth of a River,
Διὰ τὴν τεναγώδη πάροδον, <em>ob limosum accessum</em>, so
that it is not to be doubted that it ought to
be rendred in this place, <em>ad vadum maris</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
rather than <em>in paludibus</em>. And so this objection
against the assertion that <em>Cæsar</em> Landed
in the <em>Downs</em>, which is known to be a
firm Champain Country without Fenns and
Morasses, will be removed; and the whole
Argument will 'tis hoped be admitted by
the Curious.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
